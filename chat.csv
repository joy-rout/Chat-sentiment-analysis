"""There was a bird that lived in the desert, very sick, without feathers, nothing to eat, drink and shelter to live, cursing his life, day and night.One day, an angel was crossing that desert and the bird stopped the angel and asked him:- Where are you going?The angel replied:- I'm going to meet God.Then, the bird asked the angel to please ask God when his suffering would end.The angel said to him:- Of course, I will do it!And the angel said goodbye to the bird.Upon meeting God, the angel shared the bird's message.The angel told him his pathetic condition and asked when his suffering would end.God replied:- During what remains of life, the bird has to suffer like this.He will not have happiness.The angel replied that when the bird heard this, it would be discouraged.So, I ask him if he could suggest a solution for this.God answered him:- Tell him to pray this way: * ""Thank you God for everything"" *The angel came back to the bird and gave him the message of God.A week later, the angel again went the same way and saw that the bird was very happy.The feathers had grown on his body, a small plant grew in the desert area, a small pond of water was also there, and the bird was already singing and dancing happily.The angel was amazed at how this happened because he remembered that God said that for what was left of life, there would be no happiness for the bird.With that restlessness in mind, he went to visit God again.The angel asked and God answered:- Yes, it was written that there would be no happiness for the bird for what remains of life, but everything changed because the bird is praying daily * ""Thank God for everything"" *, in each situation.When the bird fell on the hot sand, it said _ ""thank God for everything"" _.When he could not fly, he repeated _ ""Thank God for everything"" _, so whatever the situation, the bird kept repeating _ ""Thank God for everything"" _ and therefore changed what was left of life in seven days"".When I heard this story, I felt a huge change in my way of feeling, thinking, accepting and seeing life.I adopted that prayer in my life.Whatever the situation I faced, I began to repeat that simple prayer * 'THANK YOU GOD FOR EVERYTHING' *.It helped me change my view of what I did not have and what I have in my life.In the same way, I started using this prayer in my life with everything I can relate to.We share this story with all my family and friends also what brought a great change in their behaviors.This simple prayer really had a profound impact on my life, I began to feel how blessed I am, how happy I am, how good life is!It can reshape our life.A simple word, a simple thought, that teaches us to be grateful for everything we have in our lives, has the power to dissolve any ""curse"" that we have been carrying all our lives._ * Be grateful and you will see the change in your life. * __ * Be humble and never have doubts. * __*Thanks God for everything...*_",positive

"*I LIVE IN A SHITHOLE*I have watched with concern how Ugandans and other African Citizens responded to *Mr Trump's* Correct Description of our habitats Africa. My Fellow *Shitholese or Shitholans* don't you see what he said was correct?*_Few Indicators that we in Uganda are more than Shitholans_*1-An MP's Salary is more than Healthcare Budget for 1,000,000 Shitholans. _Ugandan General Hospitals get about 200million Ugx per year while a single MP get 340million Ugx per year with regular huge bribe of say 29million etc_2-Health Centre IV which gets 28million per year is to serve 100,000 Shitholans. Take Arua Municipal with population of about 90,000 gets 28million per year for their Health 10 times what their MP gets.3-It is only in Uganda that A president does not work for his country but his children and grandchildren. _the same person can say African problem is their leaders who over stay in power. That means M7 in 1986 acknowledged that we are in a *SHITHOLE* which unfortunately he got used to the unpleasant smell of the SHITHOLE to the extend that he sees no reason to call it so_5-It is only in a SHITHOLE  country that a S.2 Drop out can be an  MP and when he pee in Public he sees nothing wrong with it. Don't you think a place where a MP urinate on the wall of National Ministry of Finance to be a really horrible SHITHOLE?6-In a shithole is where a Sector like Agriculture which Employs about 80% of the Population gets less than 3% of National Budget.7-In a SHITHOLE Country like mine a Primary teacher gets 110$ per Month but an MP gets 500$ per day as SDA when he crosses the Country. The same MP then Wanders why his children in Primary seven perform poorly.8-In a SHITHOLE you will have a Minister who gets treatment in outside country(Both Ministers of Health) daughter of a good President can not give birth in a National Referral Hospitals.9-Look around if you have teachers who send their children to study in a private school not the one where he/she teaches. Where you see a Doctor not getting treatment from where he/she works then know that either you are in a shithole or worse place than SHITHOLE.10-If you have citizens who vote because they received bribe from their leaders then know that you are Shitholan like me._Ugandans complain when their MPs receive bribe from M7 to lift age limit but they never complain while receiving 2000Ugx each to vote for such an MP. *What goes around comes around* lets enjoy our SHITHOLE Uganda.I used to hate *Mr Trump* but regrete my actions. We need another *Mr Trump in UK, France, Germany and China*. Cut donation to all these Shitholans who can't even maintain Blood Transfusion Services but steal the money meant to keep their Citizens healthy and alive.*_Share to all SHITHOLE Citizens like me_*😤😤😤😤haha...forwarded as received..",positive

"WHISPER OF HOPE DEVOTIONALSUNDAY – 21st JANUARY 2018SCRIPTURE REFERENCEMATTHEW 6:31-33“Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.""REFLECTIONTo worry is to “give way to anxiety or unease; allow one’s mind to dwell on difficulty or trouble.” The word itself comes from the Old English wyrgan, which means to strangle or to seize by the throat. Worry happens when you are so concerned about the problems of life that you can’t think of nothing else. It is an all-consuming feeling of uncertainty and fear. Worry displaces God in your life. When you worry, you are living as though God did not exist, and you are living as though you alone can solve your problems. Worry also distracts you from the things that really matter in life. As long as you are worrying, you can’t do anything else. You are strangled by worry.PRAYERFather today I refuse to be weary in my soul by worrying. I Put my hope and trust in Jesus. It is well with me in Jesus name!",positive

"""Entamu yo ewunzikibwa leero"" a Luganda word literally meaning that 'You are dying today' said the two men disguised as electricty subcontractor workers as they tried to slit the throat of a defenceless 51-year-old woman in Jjanda Namugongo Zone, Kira Municipality Wakiso District.Kira Division Police is holding two men for alleged attempted murder CRB:02/2018.The suspects identified as Ssekiyivu Mohammed and Kibuuka Farouk were tipped off about a woman that had received 150million Uganda shillings the previous day.The two men disguised as HASO Engeeners Company workers a company located in Kiwatule working as a subcontractor to UMEME  (Uganda's Leading Electricity Distribution Company) entered the premises of one NasoziVictoria at around 1:30pm dressed in overalls and requested to inspect the YAKA meter.The kids suspected the men were not behaving like electric workers hence decided to follow and monitor them as they inspected the meter. Its at this point that they were ordered to enter the bedroom,locked up and told to say their final prayersVictoria narrates that one of the men held her by the neck, pulled an axe from the trouser,a cello tape,rope, hit her forehead and began to slit her throat with a small sharp knifeIt was at this point as the helpless woman began to cry begging for mercy that the house maid made a loud alarm through the back window attracting help and attention from all the neighbors .Police was alerted immediately and swung in saving the men from being lynched by the angry mob.While calming down the angry mob, DPC Kira Division ASP. Kiribwa Shifah advised the residents to tighten home security by always demanding for identification from the servicemen,always have numbers of the utility area managers and embrace  the Mayumba Kumi System where every one is one another's keeper.HASO Engineers Company Limited supervisors on visiting the police station could not identify and completely denied the two suspects being their employees.",positive

"*Whatever comes your way as you journey into this New Year, remember the lesson of this story...*👇A little boy and his father visited the country store, and upon leaving the store, the owner of the store offered the little boy some free Sweets... “Get a hand full of Sweets"", the merchant said to the boy.The boy just stood there looking up at his father. The owner repeated himself:- “Son get a hand full of Sweets... it’s free.” Again the boy did not move, continuing to look up in the face of his father.Finally the father reached into the candy jar and got a hand full of Sweets and gave it to his son.As they walked back home, the father stopped and asked his son why he did not grab a hand full of the free candy. The boy with a big smile on his face looked into the face of his father and said:- *“Because I know that your HAND is BIGGER than mine.”*So, whatever your needs are  this year, please place them in the *FATHER'S HAND IN HEAVEN,* because HIS HAND is BIGGER THAN YOURS. 🙏🙏🙏",positive

They then shared the sweets equally among themselves, ate the sweets and enjoyed themselves very well.When the Anthropologist asked them why they did so?,They *all* answered *""Ubuntu""*.Which means:-*How can one be happy when the others are sad?*Ubuntu in their language means: -*""I am because we are""*This is a *strong message* for all generations.

He had hired over 50 employees left them without a pay.He also tricked a Forex Bureau when he contacted one in town and told themhe wanted change Uganda shillings into foreign currency, staff of the bureau took Euros 50,000/= (sh229m) and $ 10,000/= to his office last Friday, hopping to get Ug. Shillings. it is alleged that after the Turkish man was handed the foreign currency,he dropped it in a safe and left the office promising to came back after a short call. The Forex bureau employees    waited and waited in vain, the police has since established that there was a hole at the bottom of the safe and the money slipped through to the next room where he picked it and fled to the airport.He never paid for the apartment he had rented in MuyengaOoh Uganda cry my country a lesson to learn here never trust people you hardly know Ugandans fell victims just because this man was white and smart, he had hired only beautiful brown girls in his office and had expensive furniture",positive

I wish to walk with you like you did to your beloved friend Enoch so that I may characterize my life with much of your presence.You began with him when he was at 65 years of age and prolonged his life till he was 365 years of age. Out of your favour he was blessed here on earth and didn’t end up dieing, for you took him to heaven.It’s a new month today, I invite you to come and begin with me. Prolong my life span so that I may live to witness much of your blessings. Charge me with authority over my life’s situations. Empower me like you did to the twelve that Jesus chose for himself.Make me a conqueror over all that poses along my path. Free me from any hangovers of last month’s failures. Fill in your blessings on this new page of my life and let me enjoy lots of breakthroughs, opportunities, healing and successes.Repeat upon me the favours you did to your friend Enoch. I believe it’s not late for you to begin with me. Let me win your favour this month of February.IN JESUS NAME I PRAY AND BELIEVE",positive

"*For the wheat lovers!!​*I  am listening to Beth Mugo talking about cancer and I must say our approach towards cancer is what fails us. Beth Mugo continues:""Screening will NOT and cannot lower the cancer cases. Machines and foundations will not stop cancer from spreading! Screening is just getting people who are already sick with cancer. The solution is targeting the people who are NOT sick and teaching them on the way forward so as not to contract cancer.It is senseless to only wait and act on people who are already sick.""Beth is saying that ""there are very many people who are going to India. A friend who has been going to India for the last three years because of cancer told me 50%of people in the cancer clinics in India are usually Kenyans. Sadly, many don't make it even after these treatments, this is the bit that we are never told.The problem in our country is over consuming wheat, animal protein and Sugar. Wheat has a protein called gluten which is the mother of all problems in the immune system. These 3 also aid and encourage the cancer cells to thrive.They also aid the other degenerative diseases especially what i call ""the 3 sisters-disease""(diabetes, athritis and high blood pressure) Believe it or not!I went through the cancer ordeal in 2006, and until I realised I am what I eat,t hat's when I healed. I have seen friends get a diagnosis, go through harsh treatments and eventually die because they only followed conventional medicines. Until and unless we go back to organic foods, fermented foods wimbi porridge for example, natural herbs, there's no end in sight.These are the things that healed me and I have  continued to embrace them as a way of life and that's why cancer has not recurred.Foundations and screenings are good, but we can do better if we teach people on the harmful products that they are consuming every day leading to the degenerative diseases.Otherwise waiting for people to get sick in order to get them through  screening so as to treat them is not logical. Someone is benefiting and I can tell you its not the sick person!""Shared in the interest of Family health.*Senator Beth amigo EGH is a Cancer survivor, and an Elder member of the Anglican Church of Kenya.**Forwarded as received*",positive

"An old church in a village in Brazil was leaking and the walls were almost collapsing, after the service the Padre asked the worshipers if they could organize a fundraising to rebuild the church... He told them to contribute whatever God has blessed each and everyone of them with. If you have some money, you can bring the money,if you earn a living by selling tomatoes in the market, you can bring the tomatoes and they get auctioned to raise the money... If you operate a hardware it would be even better, you can bring some nails and iron sheets for the roof... whatever you have. Eventually, it was the day of fundraising and worshippers came out in large numbers, some with money in their pockets others with goods depending on their jobs and sources of livelihood... They were met by a strange sight; a coffin at the entrance of the church!...Gosh! Who had died?... but then again it was on a Sunday and funeral services were never conducted on Sundays.... What was going on? People started talking in whispers asking what was the meaning of it...they started pointing fingers to an old man seated at a corner; he was the coffin maker...some looked at him in open hostility, but he didn't mind them... the Padre had said that people should bring whatever God has blessed you with, right?... and he was a coffin maker... After the service it was time to raise funds ; those who had money contributed, hardware people gave iron sheets and other building equipments and materials ,tomatoes' traders had brought their tomatoes which were auctioned away... Finally, the coffin maker dragged his coffin to the front of the church and stood still... people gasped and fell silent... you could hear a pin drop . Suddenly an old man, a friend of the coffin maker stood up....he offered 15,000 for the coffin on behalf of the padre... said he was buying it for the padre... The Padre shot up so fast with eyes wide open....his lips suddenly very dry. He quickly offered 20,000 for the coffin on behalf of the leader of CWA (Catholic women Association) The Lady nearly stumbled as she sprang to her feet looking so shocked at seeing her coffin..."" No! no! no!"" She shouted ""it is not mine! ...i ...i...i...will buy it for the Catechist!... 30,000 please!... please! The Catechist nearly peed on himself he turned to look at her angrily as if to ask "" do you want to kill me?!"" Clearly nobody wanted the coffin and it kept on being passed around until finally another old rich man stood and said that, he is offering 100,000 for the coffin and he is buying it on behalf of the coffin maker... The coffin maker took his coffin and returned it to his shop....smiling. The coffin maker; someone who was looked down upon, someone whom people jeered that he benefits from the misfortunes of others raised the greatest amount of money for the church without contributing even a single coin. You can serve God in many different ways. Perhaps people belittle you until you see yourself as a nobody.....but God want you just the way you are. He will turn your shame into honor.",positive

"Something interesting regarding those who believe and those who don't believe in God! Very interesting. It stimulates our lateral thinking.This lovely parable is from ""Your Sacred Self"" by Dr. Wayne Dyer.In a mother’s womb were two babies. One asked the other: “Do you believe in life after delivery?”The other replied, “Why, of course. There has to be something after delivery. Maybe we are here to prepare ourselves for what we will be later.”“Nonsense” said the first. “There is no life after delivery. What kind of life would that be?”The second said, “I don’t know, but there will be more light than here. Maybe we will walk with our legs and eat from our mouths. .”The first replied, “That is absurd. Walking is impossible. And eating with our mouths? Ridiculous! The umbilical cord supplies nutrition and everything we need.”And moreover if there is life, then why has no one ever come back from there? Delivery is the end of life, and in the after-delivery there is nothing but darkness and silence and oblivion. It takes us nowhere.”“Well, I don’t know,” said the second, “but certainly we will meet Mother and she will take care of us.”The first replied “Mother? You actually believe in Mother? That’s laughable. If Mother exists then where is She now?”The second said, “She is all around us. We are surrounded by her. We are of Her. It is in Her that we live. Without Her this world would not and could not exist.”Said the first: “Well I don’t see Her, so it is only logical that She doesn’t exist.”To which the second replied, “Sometimes, when you’re in silence and you focus and listen, you can perceive Her presence, and you can hear Her loving voice, calling down from above.”May be this was one of the best explanations to the concept of 'GOD' :)",positive

"This message has Awoken me dearly and I think you need it too. I thought I should share as received.RIGHTEOUS IDOL WORSHIPPER?I wondered why I was in the queue of accused at all. I am intelligent, aggressive, young, totally committed to my God. What am I doing here with this sheet of supposed sins in my hand I wondered?I don’t drink, I don't smoke, I don’t fornicate, I don’t steal, I am righteous. Others should be here not me.It was finally my turn to face the Man.I placed my sheet before Him, He glanced at it and sighed softly. He looked at me and calmly said, ‘Guilty of idol worship.'Imagine my anger, my fury, my indignation. I jumped out of the chair and said ‘Of course not! Check the sheet again, check the name, It can't be mine.’He sighed again and mentioned one of my names that no one knows.I would not be stopped. It's impossible’ I yelled. I worship only God, the Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, the King of kings and Lord of lords. I bow down to none, I have no talisman, no amulet, no pot underneath my bed.‘You are guilty of idol worship’ He repeated calmly.He looked at me, I looked at Him. It seemed like forever. The room was silent. I could hear the clock ticking.Then slowly I understood.I am never late for bus/train station or air flight but I am always late to church - I blinked.My payments to services I enjoy eg: Dstv, phone bills etc, are never late but I haven’t given offerings/tithes in three months - I looked down.When meeting one of our local chiefs last week I would not even pick a call in the presence of earthly royalty, but I WhatsApp in churchI wouldn’t interrupt my performance appraisal with my boss for anything but I missed church last week because of a series on TVI wouldn’t let a day end without talking to my spouse but today I just said Hi God, Bye God. And I didn’t even pray last night - The room began to feel hot.I would never miss going to the bank because of the weather but I missed fellowship on Tuesday and Thursday because it was drizzling .I would wear my party colors to party meetings and not care what anyone thought of me but I hate to talk to my workmates about God because of what they will think of me.I always have the latest tech gadget you can think of but my bible is so worn out. I can’t even find the book of Jude in my bible anymore.The last thing to touch before going to bed is my phone and the first thing in the morning....chating on whatapp or replying offline messages. And never bordering to talk with God or reading His word.I felt so hot in the room, a nervous sweat on my forehead, I felt so ill and weak, all of my anger and self-righteousness was gone, leaving immense guilt in its wake.I slowly got off the chair and knelt by His feet and said ‘I am sorry, I am guilty as charged, Guilty of idol worship, guilty of placing others; humans, technology before You. I am guilty of idol worship.’He smiled gently, looked at me with those passionate eyes of His full of love and He gave me a fresh sheet!and said, Deliver souls!!If time would permit u, u can also share or inform others to alert them as I know they are not aware of what they are doing.God bless you.

"God hv mercy on us all. Received from someone and shared;I was walking around in a Big Bazaar store shopping, when I saw a Cashier talking to a boy couldn't have been more than 5 or 6 years old..The Cashier said, 'I'm sorry, but you don't have enough money to buy this doll. Then the little boy turned to the cashier and asked: are you sure I don't have enough money?''The cashier counted his cash once again and replied: ''You know that you don't have enough money to buy the doll, my dear.'' The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand.Finally, I walked toward him and I asked him who he wished to give this doll to. 'It's the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much . I wanted to Gift her for her BIRTHDAY.I have to give the doll to my mommy so that she can give it to my sister when she goes there.' His eyes were so sad while saying this. 'My Sister has gone to be with God.. Daddy says that Mommy is going to see God very soon too, so I thought that she could take the doll with her to give it to my sister...''My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mommy not to go yet. I need her to wait until I come back from the mall.' Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me 'I want mommy to take my picture with her so my sister won't forget me.' 'I love my mommy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me, but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister.' Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly..I quickly reached for my wallet and said to the boy. 'Suppose we check again, just in case you do have enough money for the doll?'''OK' he said, 'I hope I do have enough.' I added some of my money to his with out him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll and even some spare money.The little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough money!'Then he looked at me and added, 'I asked last night before I went to sleep for God to make sure I had enough money to buy this doll, so that mommy could give It to my sister. He heard me!'' 'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I didn't dare to ask God for too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose. My mommy loves white roses.'I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind.Then I remembered a local news paper article two days ago, which mentioned a drunk man in a truck, who hit a car occupied by a young woman and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-sustaining machine, because the young woman would not be able to recover from the coma. Was this the family of the little boy?Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the news paper that the young woman had passed away.. I couldn't stop myself as I bought a bunch of white roses and I went to the funeral home where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wishes before her burial.She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place, teary-eyed, feeling that my life had been changed for ever...The love that the little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to this day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a second, a drunk driver had taken all this away from him.Please DO NOT DRINK & DRIVEThe value of a man or woman resides in what he or she gives, not in what they are capable of receiving.",positive

"Hey pipo, as we mourn for susan magara who was kidnapped and found Dead days ago....kidnapping is getting out of control in Uganda especially Kampala... just in case you are the next in the target, try these security measures.1) When going to use a boda you have never used...Take a photo of his ID and send it to the person at your next destination. If the Boda guy has no ID dont rely on the number plate especially at night..there are hundreds of plates out there.This method keeps the criminal in check if they had intentions to misbehave.If boda chap hesitates to show ID...run like hell.2) If you normally arrive home late while driving, avoid parking close to the gate as you wait for it to be opened , it interferes with the attackers plan. Most of the people attacked have no room to reverse back or accelerate forward considering that auto cars have acceleration limitations. Give yourself space where you can use your vehicle as a weapon...depending on the clearance at your gate.3) The value of your phone gives the boda/Taxi guy an impression that you are loaded... avoid being on the phone during a boda/Taxi ride.5) Never allow a boda/Taxi guy suggest a route for you in the night. They have crime accomplices planted on the route...6) If you are using Uber or boda from a party or wherever but going separate ways...use one Uber for the whole stretch to avoid splitting into small vulnerable groups. This ensures safety as any smart criminal guy will be overwhelmed by numbers and by the time of dropping the last individual...you have picked enough clues about the driver. Do step #1 on anyone taking you anywhere...paranoia saves lives...7) Avoid sitting in the front seat with the chauffer...let him do some work to stop the car and find you behind at least.8) If a chauffer makes an unscheduled stop, make a call or feign a call and 'report' the incident in a rude way...something like 'This chap is stopping all the time I don't trust him...I think he is a crook...anyway just know I think I am not safe...' criminals especially sexual offenders pretend to be friendly...when you are defensive they back off...9) Keep a weapon in the driver's side and the passenger's side....your life could be saved by something as small as a screwdriver.10) Buy and walk with paper spray...it needs no licence like a gun.11)In an event that your car breaks down in a night travel, never stay inside it, move out to an observation point because it is highly unlikely that anyone except the police will approach the car to inqire what the trouble is. Its easy to fall asleep in the car and become more vulnerable to an attack you have no chance to run away from. You have options when at a distance from the car. You have an option to flee or fight when not enclosed. Staying inside your car could get you killed by a speeding car because of visibility issues.12) To my friends who have no exposure to guns and blasts...when a an unusual sound rings in the skies...it is not the time to ask mbu what was that...it is time to take cover and cockroach crawl away from where you are...stop screaming and alerting the shooter that you are alive and scared...13) Never run in a straight line when fleeing bullets...Stay safe out there....",positive

"After I retired, my wife insisted that I accompany her on her trips to Walmart. Unfortunately, like most men, I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and get out. Equally unfortunate, my wife is like most women she loves to browse.Yesterday my dear wife received the following letter from the local WalmartDear Mrs. Woolf,Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion in our store. We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to ban both of you from the store. Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Woolf, are listed below and are ""documented by our video surveillance cameras"":1.

July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to thewomen's restroom.4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an officialvoice, 'Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away'. This caused theemployee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted in management getting involved causing management to lose time and costing the company money.5. August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to reserve a bag ofchips.6. August 14: Moved a 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.7. August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told thechildren shoppers they could come in if they would bring pillows andblankets from the bedding department - to which twenty childrenobliged.8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he begancrying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?'Emergency Medics were called.9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.10. September 10: While handling guns in the Sports department, heasked the clerk where the antidepressants were.11. October 3: Darted around the Store suspiciously while loudlyhumming the ' Mission Impossible' theme.12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his 'Madonna look' by using different sizes of funnels.13. October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsedthrough, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!'14. October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed the fetal position and screamed 'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!15.

"*TRUE STORY.*Many years ago, on New Year's Day, a very rich man who had no wife, no children, no other family members, decided to invite all the employees of his villa to dinner.He called the staff and asked them to sit at the table.In front of everyone, there was a BIBLE and a small sum of MONEY.After everyone was installed, the man asked:*""What would you prefer to receive as a gift; this BIBLE or this MONEY?*Do not be shy, you can choose what you want.""# THE GUARDIAN was the first to react:""Sir, I would love to receive the Bible, but since I have not learned to read, the money will be more useful to me.""# THE GARDENER was the second to speak:""Sir, my wife is very sick and that's why I need more money, otherwise I would choose the Bible for sure!""# The third was the COOK:""Sir, I like reading to tell the truth, it's one of the things I like to do, but I work so hard that I never find time to flip through a magazine, let alone the Bible. I will take the money.""# In the end, it is the turn of the boy who takes care of the animals of the villa.And as the gentleman of the villa knew that the boy's family was very poor, he stepped forward and said:""Surely you too want the money, do you nit?""So you can buy food to have a good dinner at home and buy new shoes.""BUT THE BOY,as was usual with him, surprised everybody with his answer:""It would not hurt to buy a turkey and other tasty food to share with my parents and siblings, I also need a pair of new shoes because mine are very old.Even so, I will choose the Bible, I have always wanted one.My mother taught me that the Word of God is worth more than gold and that it is more tasty than a honeycomb.""After receiving the Bible, the boy immediately puffed it out and found two envelopes inside.In the first, there was a check that was 10 times higher than the money on the table.In the second, there was a document that made (whoever would choose the Bible), the heir to the wealth of the rich man!Faced with the boy's emotion and the astonishment of the other servants, the gentleman opened one of the Bibles and read aloud so that everyone could hear:*Psalms 19: 7-10:*The law of the LORD is perfect, it restores the soul;The testimony of the Lord is true, he makes wise the ignorant.The ordinances of the LORD are righteous, they rejoice the heart;The commandments of the Lord are pure, they light up the eyes.The fear of the Lord is pure, it subsists forever;The judgments of the Lord are true, they are all just.They are more precious than gold, than a lot of fine gold; They are sweeter than honey, than the one that pours rays.May God give us wisdom and help us always make the right choice.So what will you do:To share this story now, delay or simply, ignore?",positive

"THE STORY BEHIND THE YOUNG BILLIONAIRE, KAZAIREHaving failed at jobs in the city, he used the UGX 20,000 left as transport back to the village to start doing what made many think he was mad.A decade later, DR EDWARD KAZAIRE has built a more than 10bn shillings Business Empire out of herbs.Kazaire Story Starts in GODKazaire’s life was like that of any other ordinary Ugandan youth until he attended the Life in the Spirit Seminar organized by the Catholic Charismatic Renewal while in his first year at the University, in 1999. He recalls, “As we studied the bible, it became clear to me that Jesus’ mission on earth was to announce good news to the poor. And good news was not for them to remain comfortable in their poverty. I realised that God wanted me to be rich for his glory. As we concluded the seminar, we were asked to write letters to Jesus. In mine, I asked for two things: that I may be rich and that I may fully serve Him.”Sometimes prayers are instantly answered, but other times a person first goes through tests before the testimony can finally come. The later was true for Kazaire. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry in 2002, he hit the streets and walked his shoes out looking for jobs left and right. “I went to Kampala Pharmaceutical Industries wishing to produce tablets but wasn’t given an opportunity. I tried my luck at National Water and Sewerage Corporation and the only available slot was for volunteering. I went to several other places and it was the same story – no jobs.”Being the first born out of eight children, Kazaire did not have anyone to pamper him; he had to survive on his own. “I decided to turn myself into a self-styled chemistry teacher and taught in three schools. But payment was only after lots of tears at some schools. A cloud of misery surrounded me. Every day that passed, things were getting tougher and rougher. This was surely not the deal I had made with Jesus. In that frustrating moment, I prayed with a brother called Charles Birungi and I felt God asking me to go back home.Back to the Village Like a FailureIn Ugandan villages, when you are a graduate and return from the city, everyone expects you to come driving and dishing out money like you own the machine that makes it. But Kazaire’s story was different. He miserably returned to Buyanja village, in Rukungiri district, with absolutely nothing – no car, no job, no money.He went to Ndama Catholic Church to spend some time praying. He narrates, “I needed divine intervention so I could know the next step. As I prayed and listened, I realised I was a chemist but did not know how to translate that into success. I needed to figure out how to make functional what I had learnt in school. I went to the dictionary and found three definitions of a ‘chemist’. The first one was “a person studying chemistry”. The second was “a person who teaches chemistry”. The third was “a person who prepares and sells medicine”. This third one touched me in the right place. I put in three more days of prayer about it.”Many people get great dreams but only a few turn them into reality. Kazaire had a rich idea, but the question was how to turn it into money. That moment came when he was seated in the house and someone crossed carrying a drum, the kind used to prepare waragi. “Suddenly, I remembered my Senior one chemistry where we learnt about distillation – the process of separating mixtures. As I turned, I looked at a eucalyptus tree and remembered that I had seen people use its leaves to cure cough. I asked myself, instead of people drinking distilled waragi to forget their problems, why not distil medicine and have them cured? I began to collect eucalyptus leaves and did local distillation. I mixed the oil I extracted and concocted a syrup I called NOCOF. People tasted it and got cured. In fact it turned out to be more powerful than any other cough syrup on the market at the time.” Who wouldn’t want such a kind of syrup?“So after that first formula, next on my agenda was peptic ulcers which I knew to be a chronic disease. I recalled that in Germany some people had used cabbages to treat chronic peptic ulcers. Yet here we ate them as vegetables. In Zimbabwe blackjack was eaten as a vegetable while in Uganda it was used to treat wounds. Since both plants were edible, I knew the issues of safety were covered and since they were both being used as medication, it meant their healing efficacy was also guaranteed. Hence I used the two herbs to create my second formula that started treating stubborn peptic ulcers.”Until then, in Uganda, herbs were mainly used by Chinese herbal scientists in towns and illiterate local herbalists and witchdoctors who gave herbal medicine a bad image. But here he was, a staunch Christian and a graduate, using herbs to cure disease. Much as it was still at a small scale, he was now sure this was the idea that would turn him into the billionaire he wanted to be, even if no one believed him. So he started spending long hours in the bush collecting all sorts of herbs, a thing that turned him into a subject of mockery, even before villagers who had never seen the light of a blackboard. He confesses he will never forget the day he passed through a trading centre carrying a sack of herbs and heard a lady laughing uncontrollably.“Eager to know what she was laughing at, I turned only to find she was pointing at me. I was so embarrassed. She claimed I had been bewitched. In that same period, many people convinced my parents to take me to Kisizi Hospital for a mental check up.”Much as he had succeeded in creating effective products, Kazaire had not yet started earning big from them. “I could not manage a big machine for extraction, so I came to the Natural Chemotherapeutics Research Laboratory in Wandegeya; I would give them herbs, they do the extraction and give me the concentrated extract that I would dilute and give to my clients. People who saw me on buses transporting herbs to Kampala believed the rumour that I was really mad. Well, sometimes what the public humiliates and sees as an activity for worthless people is the genuine route to prosperity.”Going CommercialI believe the Zimbabwean telecom billionaire, Strive Masiyiwa, when he says that building a big business goes beyond creating a good product and putting it onto the market. He insists that one needs to build the right team, keep benchmarking him/herself against the best in the world, keep thinking and keep innovating. This is exactly what Kazaire did as he found himself in a corner. He had started packing his products and people were now coming to buy only for his father to tell him, “My home is not a clinic; get out.”“I was already earning about Shs 100,000 per week. So I took a step and established a small clinic near my home and called it Kazire Clinic of Phototherapy.” Word of mouth marketed him like a wildfire. Later, he secured airtime on radio stations such as Voice of Kigezi to share his healthy living message. I remember my own dad was an ardent listener of his radio programs that whenever he went on air, we had to pause anything and everything.By this time his products were being used in several districts like Kabale, Kisoro, Rukungiri, Ntungamo, Mbarara, Bushenyi and Kanungu. He was slowly becoming an authoritative point of reference for those who wanted to improve their health, to the extent that many people would come to consult him before taking what the medical doctors had prescribed. At one point, to boost his knowledge, Kazaire went to China and did post-graduate studies in dietorytherapy and nutrition. While there, he learnt that the Chinese use herbs a lot and it is one of the reasons they live longer.Kazaire TodayWith unbreakable faith, passion, sweat and prayer, Dr Kazaire has curved for himself a business empire that’s now estimated at over 10 billion shillings, making him one of the youngest billionaires in Ugandan shilling terms and a millionaire in US dollars. He chose the brand name Kazire in honor of his grandfather who once built a big business out of motorcades in the 1960s. His company, Kazire Herbal Products directly employs over 100 people and indirectly over 5,000 people. He owns a gigantic factory that stands in Mbarara town. Though still under construction, it is already functional, producing 800 cartons of juice per day. “I still need 14 billion shillings to make this plant serve the community satisfactorily. When I complete it, it will be able to produce 5,000 cartons a day,” he explains.The factory produces an array of products. Kazire Orange Tea Drink, which boosts eye sight, empowers the digestive tract in addition to boosting appetite and the immune system, is a natural energy drink that is extracted from oranges, pineapples, carrots, green organic tea and honey. Kazire Lemon Green Tea Drink is extracted from natural and organic lemon, green tea and honey. It is both a stimulant and an antioxidant. It reduces the severity of asthma and bronchitis, lowers blood cholesterol and stops oestrogen from stimulating growth of cancer cells in the ovaries, colon, stomach, lungs, small intestines and other parts of the body. Kazire VIT Fruit Drink is made out of beetroot, hibiscus sabdariffa and honey. It reduces the severity of ulcers, increases blood volume and body cells, and gets rid of headaches and memory loss. Kazire Aloe Green Tea Drink from aloevera, organic green tea, lemon and ginseng clears bone, joint and back pain. It handles constipation and prevents regular fevers. It also helps people with diabetes and hypertension. The factory also produces mineral water under the brand name: Kazire Water.These products have become so popular that in some places even when planning for a party people have to budget for soda, water and Kazire products. All these products are non-alcoholic and organic as opposed to GMOs (genetically modified organisms). They have been certified by UNBS (Uganda National Bureau of Standards) and are now in most shops and supermarkets in Uganda. In Kampala, they are in Capital Shoppers, Quality Supermarkets, plus several shops in Kikuubo and other places around the city. The company is based in Mbarara, but has a distribution point in Kampala. “When I finish building my factory, I will begin exporting to Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania and South Sudan.” As he says this, the look on his face shows a passionate dreamer who won’t stop until he reaches the top. He says he is still negotiating with Jesus to make him the youngest billionaire on the African continent.Dr Kazaire has planted most of the raw materials he uses. He owns over 1,300 acres of land where he grows lemons, pineapples, oranges, green tea, aloevera and more than 100 other traditional herbs. Some of the lemons he uses are so rare that he gets them from Arua and Soroti and plans to begin importing them from Tanga in Tanzania. He also has an agreement with Isingiro district local government to supply one million lemon seedlings to farmers in the district freely. The catch is that he holds the right to buy the lemons from the farmers after harvesting.An Inspiration to ManyIf you are looking for inspiration, then Dr Kazaire’s story is a piece of meat that you should chew the way a cow chews the cud. Looking into his eyes, you see a man beaming with a sense of inner satisfaction. His testimony is evidence that there is no river wide enough to cut us from our destiny. All we need is to build a bridge. You and I can build that bridge with creative thinking. “There’s no successful entrepreneur whose major job is not thinking,” Dr Kazaire explains. “Actually I turned an entrepreneur when I was seated, frustrated, thinking of what I should do next, that moment when the sight of a man carrying a drum triggered ideas in my mind.”Charles Birungi, who prayed with Kazire the day he got the conviction to return to the village, now Senior Economics Advisor with UNAIDS in Kenya, remarks: “I have known Kazaire for the last 14 years. He always strives for excellence, even in little matters. I am not surprised that he has achieved phenomenal excellence in big things.” Peter Karecera, the brain behind Waterfalls Express (Jet Car Wash) and Home Improvements Ltd, says, “Rockefeller triggered an oil revolution, Edson invented a bulb, Kazaire has created health solutions.”We are living in a conceptual age where it’s no longer physical strength, educational level or family background that matters, but how creative and innovative one is. It’s the extent to which we can create solutions to humanity’s problems that propels us to greatness. In his 30s, Dr Kazaire looks like a youth in 20s. But his small body houses a giant mind and even a bigger heart. Often people come to his factory and upon seeing him they insist their issues can be disclosed only to Mzee Kazaire, unaware it’s him!Dr Kazire’s products are a master stroke of science and divine power. After production, he prays over them asking God to use them to heal his people. To those who think they can use evil powers to succeed, he warns, “There’s no future for those who practice witchcraft or sacrifice their children to get rich. It always ends badly for them. What we need is divine intervention from God. Without God you will start a business and it fails for no apparent reason. You get money and spend it on a sickness. You get a job and lose it in unclear ways. But the moment we seek God, in the spiritual world we receive and that later manifests in the physical realm. Hence after prayer, we need to continue dreaming about what we have prayed for. You can’t pray for a car and dream about a bicycle. And you won’t dream spending on Champaign before you have saved enough to buy the car.”According to him, a functioning human being is made up of two parts – the physical and the spiritual, the inner person and the outer person. “I know that the outer me is weak; it suffers sicknesses and can get tired, lazy and bored. It can fail. But the inner me, the Spirit in me, is powerful, gifted, irresistible, courageous, persevering and will always push the outer me to do the right thing. If I want to wake up at 3am the physical me might say, ‘It is still cold; continue hugging your wife,’ but the inner me will insist that it’s time to get up and pray or read a book,” he says amidst laughter.Dr Kazaire advises everyone who wants to grow their money never to forget to tithe. He remarks, “If you want to keep poor, cheat God. If you don’t tithe, in the spiritual realm you are a debtor and that follows you in the physical realm. That’s why some people get loans but never pay back. If your paper notes, from Shs 50,000 down to Shs 1,000 have never gone to Church to pray and it’s only your coins that pray, you are most likely going to live a life of coins.” Paskazia Tumwesigye, a communication practitioner, testifies, “One of the unique traits about Dr Kazaire is his ability to blend business with faith. One time I listened to him speak about how he had relaxed on tithing the appropriate amount because it felt high only for his income to start crippling until he resumed giving God what is truly His and his business resurrected. From that time on, I started practically giving tithe in its fullness and now I see results.”“Once you have a dream, start with whatever you have,” advises the accomplished billionaire. “My capital was 20,000 shillings, the transport that took me to the village. Business ideas are everywhere. You can even get one by checking in the trash bins to see what kind of products are commonly used in the area. I call this environmental scanning.”History will never forget July 1979 when Peter Kazaire and Komushana Olive gave birth to a baby that was to grow into this celebrated industrialist – Dr Edward Kazaire. With all this success, he remains very humble, always praising God together with his wife Tukwasibwe Evas and three boys and one girl that God has blessed them with.",positive

Never repossess what you once gave a parent.3. Never interrogate parents regarding WHAT THEY DID with the last money you gave them. You can find out wisely.  But once you realise it may raise issues, leave it at that.4. Never lecture parents regarding their apparent weaknesses. You have not outlived them. And you haven't lived long enough.5. A parent may take you to court, repossess what he gave you, interrogate you and even lecture you.6. WISE PEOPLE CAN STAND A PARENT'S SPIT ON THEIR FACES. THEY KNOW IT'S A BLESSING INDISGUISE.7.

"ʟᴇᴛ's ᴛʜɪɴᴋ ᴀʙᴏᴜᴛ ᴛʜɪs.The moment you get out of bed, wash your face, water Company Ltd. National water and sewerage will be reading  their meters. You brush your teeth, Mukwano or Colgate will be earning on you. When you Charge your phone UMEME  will be reading their meter. When you move from your house  to the office, taxi owners,are making money on you .If u are driving Petrol Station  Owners will be collecting their shares and when you check your WhatsApp, Facebook and other social media, MTN, Orange and Airtel will be making money on you!So before you get out of the house you have already paid all these companies something. You have already spent money.Let's not even talk about the rest of the day.So if you are going to bed without making money, how are you going to manage all these bills??Do something about your life today.Start thinking about how to make money everyday. Think Residual Income Start with a small targeted amount and grow as you go. Start with something that will give u even if its 500 Ug shillings a day. Its better than going to bed without making even a 1000 shillingsLet's Put our faith into action, take risks and start something!SALARY alone can not solve your money problems. You need Secondary Source of income to balance.SALARY is a MEDICINE for managing POVERTY, it doesn't CURE it. Only your BUSINESS or INVESTMENTS Cures Poverty.Be Financially Intelligent... Have a Plan B. This post was sent to me by a friend. I couldn't have it alone. I find it inspirational.",positive

"*A drunkard woke up one morning deeply repentant after a bitter fight with his wife the previous night. He noticed with dismay the crate of beer bottles that had caused the fight. He took it outside and started smashing the empty bottles one by one onto the wall. He smashed the first bottle swearing... ""You are the reason I fight with my wife!"" He smashed the second bottle... ""You are the reason I don't love my children!"" He smashed the third bottle.... ""You are the reason I don't have a decent job!""...

"THE PRICE OF PEACE AND HARMONY IN EVERY MARRIAGE.Many years ago I listened to a preacher share about how his wife would leave the television on at night and sleep off and they lived in a country where you pay based on how long you keep the TV on. Leaving the TV on therefore increases the television bill.That attitude of his wife would annoy him and he was always angry at his wife for doing that yet it continued. It was obvious it was going to become a strain in the marriage.Then one day while ruminating over this issue,I asked myself, “Is your marriage not worth fifty dollars extra at the end of the month? If this attitude of your wife will mean an extra bill of fifty dollars is it too much to pay for peace to be in your marriage?”Unlike me, my wife is not a morning person. I can wake up by 2:00am, work till 5:00am, go back to bed and still get up by 6:00am and start my day. For my wife, I literally have to drag her out of bed in the morning. Her day begins only after she has had her bath.In some homes, the wife is the one who goes to the kitchen to heat up water for the family to bathe. I guess it comes naturally with women. In my home, heaven help me if I wait for my wife to do that. I will wait for a long time. So I have resolved to make that my responsibility.Even with the kids I will still have to be the one doing that in the morning because my wife is not a morning person. If that is the price I have to pay for peace to be in my home, it is worth it. We are talking about the price of peace.One of my friends shared with me how his wife will never monitor the fuel gauge when driving. It is when the car finally stops that she realizes the car has run out of fuel. Guess who she will call? The husband. He will have to be the one to sort out the problem.After several of such calls he had to find a way around it. He ensures the fuel tank is full at the beginning of the week which will take the wife through the week. That way he does not get any phone call that the car has stopped. It is the price of peace for him.When I was working on this article I requested that people share some of the prices they have had to pay to maintain peace in their homes. I got a lot of responses that revealed that no marriage is perfect. The reason we see certain marriages as better than ours is because the parties in those marriages are ready to pay certain prices to maintain peace in their homes.Let me share a few of the responses I got.""In my home I just have to tolerate my husband’s attitude. He has this habit of talking over issues repeatedly. He can talk, talk and talk when a situation happens and will nag you till you fall over. So to allow peace what I do is try and keep my mouth shut. No argument, no talking back or simply walk away so that peace can reign.""-Ajoke Mariam Osikoya""I usually don't turn off the lights in a room when I'm done using it. At the beginning of my marriage hubby will tell me to always make sure I do that when exiting the room, but after correcting me several times without change, he decided to just check back anytime I leave a room and will help turn the lights off. He just stopped complaining and started helping me do it. Eventually, I had to determine in myself to be more aware and I've gotten better doing that.-Olubunmi Adeleye,""My wife has a thing for matchsticks. After using one, she keeps it for 'emergency'. This act irritates me. No matter how long we discuss this (more than 9 years now) she still does. So I decided to dispose them and then I offer her a fresh one should an 'emergency' arise.""-Dapo Shodunke""I don't pressurize my husband to do or not to do anything, especially something he really wants to, or really doesn't want to do. Putting pressure on him will only irritate him. I keep quiet and I pray instead. That way, I have peace and also get what I want. On the other hand, my husband will always hang the mosquito nets, switch off the lights and unplug my phones, because I always sleep off. He has stopped complaining. He will do the job instead.""-Bisola Muktar MaryThose were just a few of the several responses I got about the price of peace that people are paying in their homes. A lot of other people were encouraged when they saw that they were not alone. You think you are the only one having an issue until you listen to others.Sometimes we need to do things we don’t like for the sake of peace. If it is not too high a price then why not just do it and move on with our lives? Not every battle is worth fighting.That is why it is important to be able to lead yourself because for these people whose reports we just read you find that either they or their spouses took responsibility for peace. That is part of what personal leadership is about.I could have picked a fight with my wife for refusing to get up from the bed in the morning. Hamzah could have picked a fight with his wife for that thing with the matchsticks. Fatimah’s husband could have picked a fight with her for always forgetting to turn off the lights. But personal leadership helped us to take the other route thereby maintaining peace in our homes.Now this does not mean you will never have to correct each other in the relationship or continually be in endurance mode throughout the marriage especially when it has to do with abuse. That is a completely different matter. You don’t endure abuse. But instead of fighting over why your spouse always presses the toothpaste tube from the middle, why not buy a second one so you have yours and he has his and both of you have peace? Has that not solved the problem?Share to save a marriage",positive

"WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE A TYRE BLOWOUT WHILE STILL IN MOTION (SPEED)In the event of the unfortunate death of Nigeria's minister of state for labour due to an accident occasioned by a tyre blowout and sometime ago and the fact that we have many untrained drivers, it has become pertinent for me to write this.There are 6 simple steps to take within a maximum of 2 minutes and you will be safe, these by the grace of God I have been familiar with for decades. They are as follow:(1) DON'T PANIC in the event of a blowout, calm yourself down fast because your car will start misbehaving and you need to take charge.(2) Hold FIRMLY to your steering wheel with both hand, NO VIGOROUS TURNING, as you concentrate on the road and your mirrors, in seconds study the movement pattern of the car. Your car will naturally swerve to the direction of the burst tyre.(3) Gradually take off your foot from the accelerator, DON'T EVER ATTEMPT TO PRESS THE BRAKES, IF YOU DO, YOU HAVE A 95% CHANCE OF A SOMERSAULT. The car will decelerate gradually while you concentrate on the road to avoid collision with any other road user.(4) Disengage the gears of the car by shifting to neutral (N) as you still maintain a firm grip on the steering wheel and put your eyes on the road.(5) After a while depending on your initial speed, your car comes to a speed less than 60km/h when it is now safe to GRADUALLY apply the brakes and navigate to the side walk(6) Ultimately, it is now safe to put the car to a complete stop and turn off the engine. You have just saved yourself and passengers from untimely death.NOTE:Of course, everyone in the car will be in a panic mode BUT this is NOT THE TIME TO LISTEN TO THEM, it is TIME TO CONCENTRATE.Please, don't just read share on your page and copy to other platforms, you may just be about to save a life.I pray that God will continue to keep us safe as we use the roads.",positive

"Be Warned!!!Dear Colleagues,Below is a report of a security incident that happened in Kampala and was circulated on a security group that I am a member of. I am sharing this information with you due to the seriousness of the incident, so that you may keep yourselves and your loved ones safe.“There must really be something sinister going on... A friend of mine underwent a similar experience on the 27th of April this year... This is his story....he was in kireka that night, so by 10pm, he decided to leave for home, he went to a supermarket just opposite that shell in kireka, to buy radio cells.. Right outside the supermarket, he sees a taxi hailing for passengers heading to namugongo and sonde, he jumped into the taxi since he is a resident of namugongo.. Shortly, a lady also comes out of the same supermarket and boards the same taxi.. They set off.. For those of you who are familiar with the kireka namugongo road, there is a junction, ideally the taxi, should have turned off to the right from kyaliwajala, but the driver rushed towards Kira.. Naturally someone had to complain.. It's on that note that the driver increased the speed, amid their protests, 4 ""passengers"" pulled out military grade benets, very long ones... And one of them ordered the passengers not to make any noise lest they are killed.. My friend says he peed in his pants... The thugs stopped the taxi in that first swamp just after Kira on Kira kasangati road.. They were told to disembark carefully.. It's when he realized that they were only 5 genuine passengers, 1 woman and 4 men, they sat them down and the 4 men were tied in pairs, bound by the legs with a wire.. (he showed us that scar as a result of the wire).. The scar was caused by the wire on his uncle.. After the men were secured... Guess what happened to the woman.. All the 5 Goons did the unthinkable to her... Used her terribly.. One of the bound me was so shocked that he tried to flee.. He was stabbed in the neck... Now the thugs asked for money.. They first came to this friend if mine.. He told them that he had no money.. They hit him with an iron bar on the head, he bled profusely... That is when he decided to release the 35k he was keeping in his socks... The young boy he was bound with told the thugs that he is an orphan who only had the taxi fare on him, the boy looked like he was in O level... The thugs were furious and said the kid was a ""kisiranii"".. The got hold of his ear and cut it off... Yes cut the young lads ear off.... Now this scared my friend, he is also attempted to ran away, only to receive a Benet stab in his shoulder.. (he has a massive scar)... After these guys were done with them, the driver jumped into the taxi.. After about 1 hour, he came back with another set of victims, but they were placed at a distance from them, so they he couldn't decipher how many women or men were there..... This is how he was released... He and the boy whose ear was chopped off were told to get up and walk with a warning of being killed if any of them looked behind.. They walked for over a kilometer, but he sensed at one point that no one was following him, so he looked behind, and truly, there was no one... Since it was late, about 3am, he went home, he only got first aid around 7am, reported at namugongo police station at the Anglican shrine... The doctor told him to watch out for a brain clot manifesting as a bleeding nose as a result of the iron bar injury.. Unfortunately he got a nose bleed two weeks ago.. He is yet to get money for further analysis...he says the thugs were constantly on phone speaking a mixture of kiswahili and a western uganda dialect. He had a feeling that they were rebels... Forgive the typos Grammar errors.. They were not intended because of the long nature of the post.. So please let's be careful.. Something wrong is going on”As you can see from the above narrative, the incident is quite worrying. I caution you all to be extra cautious about your personal safety especially when using taxis late at night.",positive

"BETTY BAKIREKE NAMBOOZEOne great writer  said that, to the living we owe respect, but to the dead we owe only the truth but when death comes more so abruptly and in such a gruesome manner like it happened to my Honourable brother Col.Ibrahim Abiriga, truth ceases to matter but the fact that a life is lost.I would therefore on my own behalf and on behalf of the people of Mukono Municipality  wish to express our condolences to his family, relatives and to the people of Arua Municipality  for this gruesome assisination that only adds to the trauma we are already suffering as a country over unexplained murders.Am however, not going to insult Abiriga's memory by pretending that  he was my freind. He was far from it....He wasn't shy about expressing his opinion....which I highly doubt was his opinion,to me he was a loud speaker for the people who have chosen to love  power more than  the future of our Uganda. He knew how to offend and irritate those of us who find Museveni's Government a curse to our country. He is one of the politicians who  really bastardised the politics of this country.  As other people were being murdered including fellow Moslems,  Abiriga clapped loudest that there should be no change...he invested all himself to maintain the status quo and it's within this status quo that he has perished.When one day I ran towards him to grab his yellow cap at Parliament,my intention was to show him that even with the guards the regime was fooling him with,it couldn't secure him fully. For that act and another of grabbing Pecos Kuteesa's military cap, I paid with my backbone. Am now maimed for life and when I returned to Parliament after hospitalisation Abiriga tried to mock me, For which I almost physically  fought with him.But when news of Abiriga's assisanation came, I went cold with pain...I cried tears, but deep inside I knew I wasn't crying for Abiriga, he was gone, I was crying for my country..... We need our colleagues like Abiriga to stay around to realise the mess we have sunk our country in and maybe join forces to dig it out of the pit. We need to reject any politics that targets people because of their political beliefs. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. Uganda will be better not  through elimination of those we don't agree with or innocent people to traumatise the Nation but because of our effort to put up systems that will work for us all irrespective of our political  beliefs.  Every life must be respected and every murder must be condemned.As we bury Abiriga, leaving his young family without a provider,it high time we all raise in one voice to say that the status quo is hopeless, there are no winners in a sinking boat IT TIME TO CHANGE even when Museveni still insists that those terrorising us are idiots we must come out boldly to tell him that we have no use with a Regime and a President who cannot successfully  deal with ""idiots"". Rest in peace Abiriga.",positive

"Two ChoicesWhat would you do?....you make the choice. Don't look for a punch line, there isn't one. Read it anyway. My question is: Would you have made the same choice?At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves children with learning disabilities, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended.After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question:'When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does is done with perfection.Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do.Where is the natural order of things in my son?'The audience was stilled by the query.The father continued. 'I believe that when a child like Shay, who was mentally and physically disabled comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes in the way other people treat that child.'Then he told the following story:Shay and I had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, 'Do you think they'll let me play?' I knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team but as a fatherI also understood that if my son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence to be accepted by others in spite of his handicaps.I approached one of the boys on the field and asked (not expecting much) if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and said, 'We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning.I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.'Shay struggled over to the team's bench and, with a broad smile, put on a team shirt. I watched with a small tear in my eye and warmth in my heart.The boys saw my joy at my son being accepted.In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the right field..Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as I waved to him from the stands.In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.At this juncture, do they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game?Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher, recognizing that the other team was putting winning aside for this moment in Shay's life, moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least make contact.The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay.As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.The game would now be over. The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman.  Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the first baseman's head, out of reach of all team mates.Everyone from the stands and both teams started yelling, 'Shay, run to first! Run to first!'Never in his life had Shay ever run that far, but he made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.Everyone yelled, 'Run to second, run to second!' Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second, gleaming and struggling to make it to the base.By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the right fielder had the ball. The smallest guy on their team who now had his first chance to be the hero for his team.He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions so he, too, intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head.Shay ran toward third base deliriously as the runners ahead of him circled the bases toward home.All were screaming, 'Shay, Shay, Shay, all the Way Shay'Shay reached third base because the opposing shortstop ran to help him by turning him in the direction of third base, and shouted, 'Run to third! Shay, run to third!'As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams, and the spectators, were on their feet screaming, 'Shay, run home! Run home!'Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the grand slam and won the game for his team.""That day', said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, 'the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world'.Shay didn't make it to another summer. He died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making me so happy, and coming home and seeing his mother tearfully embrace her little hero of the day!AND NOW A LITTLE FOOT NOTE TO THIS STORY:We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people hesitate.The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools and workplaces.If you're thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that you're probably sorting out the people in your address book who aren't the 'appropriate' ones to receive this type of message Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a difference.We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the 'natural order of things.'So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice:Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up those opportunities and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?A wise man once said every society is judged by how it treats its least fortunate amongst them.May your day, be a Shay Day.",positive

"Hi everyone. Grandpa's unwell he has a fractured right hip born since  Oct 8, 2017 and a broken left hip born since May 18th 2018.  Although he has improved and is off oxygen, eating a bit and is back home in Rubaga,  he requires daily nursing. This means a fee equivalent to 1,800,000/= per month without meds. His immediate children our parents have done their best but its becoming more and more challenging by the day. The next deposit for the nursing is due on the 28th of June and this is a plea for help.We can make individual discretionary contributions to this by sending anything you can to me through mobile money 0772659191 with reason Grandpa Nursing or onto my Stanbic account Joan Ntabadde held at Nakasero Branch 9030010354179 and I will consolidate it into a lumpsum generation contribution. The narrative if on account can be your name and I'll know it's purpose. I will share and acknowledge receipt of all contributions and keep you and the first generation updated of where we stand.I have not referred to jajjas account so that we don't mix the purpose of the funds with other matters arising etc. Ofcourse other suggestions are welcome.You are all dears and are always very much appreciated, only do contribute if you can and any amount you can.

"Okay the medics ie Solome and others have advised that he is not able to walk as the recovery process is a bit different. Our mwami, grand father couldn't be operated  so we are letting nature take its course which means it takes 6-12 weeks for a fracture to unite so in this case the leg can't be moved; therapy is there to try to improve blood circulation; reduce blood clots, maintain  muscle bulk. This is where we have a nurse to support his recovery therapy and meds.",positive

"🆘❌🆘❌🆘❌🆘❌👉 *ALL LADIES MUST READ*〰〰〰〰〰〰〰This message fromMr. Khalid Javed AlkhailiDated : 20th July 2017Based : LondonPosition : Senior Nursing Officer*AVOID EATING DEADLY CHICKEN BONES**PLEASE IF YOU DECIDE TO DIE, DIE OF ANYTHING BUT IGNORANCE**STOP CHEWING CHICKEN BONES BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE POISON LIES IN THE BONE*Avoid eating chicken wings frequently - ladies, especially;*a true story*...!A friend of mine recently had a growth in her womb and she underwent an *operation to remove the…. The cyst removed was filled with dark colored blood.* She thought that she would recover after the surgery but! She was terribly wrong.A relapse occurred just a few months later. Distressed, she rushed down to her gynecologist for a consultation.During her consultation, *her doctor asked her a question that puzzled her. He asked if she was a frequent consumer of chicken wings and she replied yes wondering as to how he knew of her eating habits.* You see, the truth is in this modern day and age; *chickens are injected with steroids to accelerate their growth so that the needs of this society can be met.*This need is none other than the need for food.*Chickens that are injected with steroids are usually given the shot at the neck or the wings.*Therefore, it is *in these places that the highest concentration of steroids exists.* These steroids have terrifying effects on the body as it accelerates growth..*It has an even more dangerous effect in the presence of female hormones, this leads to women being more prone to the growth of a cyst in the womb.*Therefore, I advise the people out there to watch their diets and to lower their frequency of consuming chicken wings!People, who receive this message *please forward it to your friends and loved ones.* I am sure no one wants to see him or her suffer!😳😰💦",positive

"Someone asked Bill Gates, Is there any person richer than you?He said, yes, only one. Many years ago, I had been dismissed and I had gone to New York airport. I read titles of newspapers there. I liked one of them and I want to buy it. But I didn't have change (coin). So abandoned the idea, suddenly, a black boy called me and told me, “This newspaper for you.” I said, but I don’t have change. He said, “No problem, I give you free”.After 3 months, I went there. Coincidentally, that story happened again and that same boy gave me another free newspaper again. I said, I can’t accept it. But he said, “I give you from my profit.”After 19 years, I had been rich and I decided to find that boy. I found him after one and half month's search. I asked him, do you know me? He said, “Yes, you’re famous Bill Gates.”I said, you gave me free newspaper 2 times many years ago. Now, I want to compensate it. I am going to give you everything that you want. Black young man replied, “You can’t compensate it!”I said, why? He said, ""Because I gave you when I was poor. You want to give me when you are rich. So, how do you compensate?""Bill Gates said, I think that black young man is richer than me.You don't have to be rich or wait to be rich to give......*Real attitude of giving is when you lack*Keep the Spirit Alive",positive

"I've Got Some Things to SayBY ROMELU LUKAKUJUN 18 2018I remember the exact moment I knew we were broke. I can still picture my mum at the refrigerator and the look on her face.I was six years old, and I came home for lunch during our break at school. My mum had the same thing on the menu every single day: Bread and milk. When you’re a kid, you don’t even think about it. But I guess that’s what we could afford.Then this one day I came home, and I walked into the kitchen, and I saw my mum at the refrigerator with the box of milk, like normal. But this time she was mixing something in with it. She was shaking it all up, you know? I didn’t understand what was going on. Then she brought my lunch over to me, and she was smiling like everything was cool. But I realized right away what was going on.She was mixing water in with the milk. We didn’t have enough money to make it last the whole week. We were broke. Not just poor, but broke.My father had been a pro footballer, but he was at the end of his career and the money was all gone. The first thing to go was the cable TV. No more football. No more Match of the Day. No signal.Then I’d come home at night and the lights would be shut off. No electricity for two, three weeks at a time. Then I’d want to take a bath, and there would be no hot water. My mum would heat up a kettle on the stove, and I’d stand in the shower splashing the warm water on top of my head with a cup.There were even times when my mum had to “borrow” bread from the bakery down the street. The bakers knew me and my little brother, so they’d let her take a loaf of bread on Monday and pay them back on Friday.I knew we were struggling. But when she was mixing in water with the milk, I realized it was over, you know what I mean? This was our life.I didn’t say a word. I didn’t want her to stress. I just ate my lunch. But I swear to God, I made a promise to myself that day. It was like somebody snapped their fingers and woke me up. I knew exactly what I had to do, and what I was going to do.I couldn’t see my mother living like that. Nah, nah, nah. I couldn’t have that.People in football love to talk about mental strength. Well, I’m the strongest dude you’re ever going to meet. Because I remember sitting in the dark with my brother and my mom, saying our prayers, and thinking, believing, knowing … it’s going to happen.I kept my promise to myself for a while. But then some days I’d come home from school and find my mum crying. So I finally told her one day, “Mum, it’s gonna change. You’ll see. I’m going to play football for Anderlecht, and it’s going to happen soon. We’ll be good. You won’t have to worry anymore.”I was six.I asked my father, “When can you start playing professional football?”He said, “Sixteen.”I said, “O.K., sixteen then.”It was going to happen. Period.Let me tell you something — every game I ever played was a Final. When I played in the park, it was a Final. When I played during break in kindergarten, it was a Final. I’m dead-ass serious. I used to try to tear the cover off the ball every time I shot it. Full power. We weren’t hitting R1, bro. No finesse shot. I didn’t have the new FIFA. I didn’t have a Playstation. I wasn’t playing around. I was trying to kill you.When I started growing taller, some of the teachers and the parents would be stressing me. I’ll never forget the first time I heard one of the adults say, “Hey, how old are you? What year were you born?”I’m like, What? Are you serious?When I was 11 years old, I was playing for the Lièrse youth team, and one of the parents from the other team literally tried to stop me from going on the pitch. He was like, “How old is this kid? Where is his I.D.? Where is he from?”I thought, Where am I from? What? I was born in Antwerp. I’m from Belgium.My dad wasn’t there, because he didn’t have a car to drive to my away games. I was all alone, and I had to stand up for myself. I went and got my I.D. from my bag and showed it to all the parents, and they were passing it around inspecting it, and I remember the blood just rushing through me … and I thought, “Oh, I’m gonna kill your son even more now. I was already going to kill him, but now I’m gonna destroy him. You’re gonna drive the boy home crying now.”I wanted to be the best footballer in Belgian history. That was my goal. Not good. Not great. The best. I played with so much anger, because of a lot of things … because of the rats running around in our apartment … because I couldn’t watch the Champions League … because of how the other parents used to look at me.I was on a mission.When I was 12, I scored 76 goals in 34 games.I scored them all wearing my dad’s shoes. Once our feet got to be the same size, we used to share.One day I called up my grandfather — my mum’s dad. He was one of the most important people in my life. He was my connection back to Congo, where my mum and dad are from. So I was on the phone with him one day, and I said, “Yeah, I’m doing really well. I scored 76 goals, and we won the league. The big teams are noticing me.”And usually, he always wanted to hear about my football. But this time it was strange. He said, “Yeah, Rom. Yeah, that’s great. But can you do me a favor?”I said, “Yeah, what is it?”He said, “Can you look after my daughter, please?”I remember being so confused. Like, what’s Grandad on about?I said, “Mum? Yeah, we’re cool. We’re O.K.”He said, “No, promise me. Can you promise me? Just look after my daughter. Just look after her for me, O.K.?”I said, “Yeah, Granddad. I got it. I promise you.”Five days later he passed away. And then I understood what he really meant.It makes me so sad to think about, because I just wish that he could have lived another four years to see me play for Anderlecht. To see that I kept my promise, you know? To see that everything was going to be O.K.I told my mum that I would make it at 16.I was late by 11 days.May 24, 2009.The playoff final. Anderlecht vs. Standard Liège.That was the craziest day of my life. But we have to back up for a minute. Because at the start of the season, I was barely playing for the Anderlecht U-19s. The coach had me coming off the bench. I’m like, “How the hell am I going to sign a pro contract on my 16th birthday if I’m still on the bench for the U-19s?”So I made a bet with our coach.I told him, “I’ll guarantee you something. If you actually play me, I’m going to score 25 goals by December.”He laughed. He literally laughed at me.I said, “Let’s make a bet then.”He said, “O.K., but if you don’t score 25 by December, you’re going to the bench.”I said, “Fine, but if I win, you’re going to clean all the minivans that take the players home from training.”He said, “O.K., it’s a deal.”I said, “And one more thing. You have to make pancakes for us every day.”He said, “O.K., fine.”That was the dumbest bet that man ever made.I had 25 by November. We were eating pancakes before Christmas, bro.Let that be a lesson. You don’t play around with a boy who’s hungry!I signed my pro contract with Anderlecht on my birthday, May 13. Went straight out and bought the new FIFA and a cable package. It was already the end of the season, so I was at home chilling. But the Belgian league was crazy that year, because Anderlecht and Standard Liege had finished tied on points. So there was a two-leg playoff to decide the title.During the first leg, I’m at home watching on TV like a fan.Then the day before the second leg, I get a phone call from the coach of the reserves.“Hello?”“Hello, Rom. What are you doing?”“About to go play football in the park.”“No, no, no, no, no. Pack your bags. Right now.”“What? What did I do?”“No, no, no. You need to get to the stadium right now. The first team wants you now.”“Yo …. What?! Me?!”“Yeah, you. Come now.”I literally sprinted into my dad’s bedroom and was like, “Yo! Get your ass up right now! We gotta go, man!”He’s like, “Huh? What? Go where?”I’m like, “ANDERLECHT, MAN.”I’ll never forget, I showed up to the stadium, and I like pretty much ran into the dressing room and the kitman said, “O.K., kid, what number do you want?”And I said, “Give me number 10.”The kitman said, “O.K., kid, what number do you want?” And I said, “Give me number 10.”Hahahaha! I don’t know. I was too young to be scared I guess.He was like, “Academy players have to take 30 and above.”I said, “O.K., well, three plus six equals nine, and that’s a cool number, so give me 36.”That night at the hotel, the senior players made me sing a song for them at dinner. I can’t even remember what I picked. My head was spinning.The next morning, my friend literally knocked on the door of my house to see if I wanted to play football and my mum was like, “He’s out playing.”My friend said, “Playing where?”She said, “The final.”We got off the bus at the stadium, and every single player walked in wearing a cool suit. Except me. I came off the bus wearing a terrible tracksuit, and all the TV cameras were right in my face. The walk to the locker room was like 300 meters. Maybe a three-minute walk. As soon as I put my foot in the locker room, my phone starts blowing up. Everybody had seen me on TV. I had 25 messages in three minutes. My friends were going crazy.“Bro?! WHY ARE YOU AT THE GAME?!”“Rom, what is happening? WHY ARE YOU ON TV?”The only person I texted back was my best friend. I said, “Bro, I don’t know if I’m gonna play. I don’t know what’s going on. But just keep watching the TV.”In the 63rd minute, the manager subbed me on.I ran out onto the field for Anderlecht at 16 years and 11 days old.We lost the final that day, but I was already in heaven. I made good on my promise to my mother and to my grandad. That was the moment I knew we were gonna be O.K.The next season, I was still finishing up my last year of high school and playing in the Europa League at the same time. I used to have to take a big bag to school so I could catch a flight in the afternoon. We won the league by a mile, and I finished second for African Player of the Year. It was just … crazy.I actually expected all that to happen, but maybe not so fast. All of sudden, the media was building me up, and putting all these expectations on me. Especially with the national team. For whatever reason, I just wasn’t playing well for Belgium. It wasn’t working out.But, yo — come on. I was 17! 18! 19!When things were going well, I was reading newspapers articles and they were calling me Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian striker.When things weren’t going well, they were calling me Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian striker of Congolese descent.If you don’t like the way I play, that’s fine. But I was born here. I grew up in Antwerp, and Liège and Brussels. I dreamed of playing for Anderlecht. I dreamed of being Vincent Kompany. I’ll start a sentence in French and finish it in Dutch, and I’ll throw in some Spanish or Portuguese or Lingala, depending on what neighborhood we’re in.I’m Belgian.We’re all Belgian. That’s what makes this country cool, right?I don’t know why some people in my own country want to see me fail. I really don’t. When I went to Chelsea and I wasn’t playing, I heard them laughing at me. When I got loaned out to West Brom, I heard them laughing at me.But it’s cool. Those people weren’t with me when we were pouring water in our cereal. If you weren’t with me when I had nothing, then you can’t really understand me.You know what’s funny? I missed 10 years of Champions League football when I was a kid. We never could afford it. I would come into school and all the kids would be talking about the final, and I’d have no idea what happened. I remember back in 2002, when Madrid played Leverkusen, everybody was like, “The volley! Oh my God, the volley!”I had to pretend like I knew what they were talking about.Two weeks later, we were sitting in computer class, and one of my friends downloaded the video off the Internet, and I finally saw Zidane smash it into the top corner with his left.That summer, I went over to his house so I could watch Ronaldo Fenomeno in the World Cup Final. Everything else from that tournament is just a story I heard from the kids at school.Ha! I remember I had holes in my shoes in 2002. Big holes.Twelve years later, I was playing in the World Cup.Now I’m about to play in another World Cup, and you know what? I’m going to remember to have fun this time. Life is too short for the stress and the drama. People can say whatever they want about our team, and about me.Man, listen — when we were kids, we couldn’t even afford to watch Thierry Henry on Match of the Day! Now I’m learning from him every day with the national team. I’m standing with the legend, in the flesh, and he’s telling me all about how to run into space like he used to do. Thierry might be the only guy in the world who watches more football than me. We debate everything. We’re sitting around and having debates about German second division football.I’m like, “Thierry, have you seen the Fortuna Düsseldorf setup, though?”He’s like, “Don’t be silly. Yes, of course.”That’s the coolest thing in the world, to me.I just really, really wish my grandad was around to witness this.I’m not talking about the Premier League.Not Manchester United.Not the Champions League.Not the World Cups.That’s not what I mean. I just wish he was around to see the life we have now. I wish I could have one more phone call with him, and I could let him know …“See? I told you. Your daughter is OK. No more rats in the apartment. No more sleeping on the floor. No more stress. We’re good now. We’re good …… They don’t have to check the I.D. any more. They know our name.”Romelu LukakuBELGIUM",positive

"Beautiful letter written by a father to his son and daughter 👌Below is a letter from a renowned Hong Kong TV broadcaster and Child Psychologist to his daughter. The words are actually applicable to all of us; young and old.This applies to all sons & daughters too.Parents can use this in their teachings to their children.Dear all,I am writing this to you because of 3 reasons1.Life, fortune and mishaps are unpredictable, nobody knows how long he lives.2. I am your father, and if I don't tell you these, no one else will.3. Whatever written is my own personal bitter experiences that perhaps could save you a lot of unnecessary heartaches.Remember the following as you go through life1. Do not bear grudge towards those who are not good to you. No one has the responsibility of treating you well, except your mother and I. To those who are good to you, you have to treasure it and be thankful, and ALSO you have to be cautious, because everyone has a motive for every move. When a person is good to you, it does not mean he really will be good to you. You have to be careful, don't hastily regard him as a real friend.2. No one is indispensable, nothing is in the world that you must possess. Once you understand this idea, it would be easier for you to go through life when people around you don't want you anymore, or when you lose what you wanted the most.3. Life is short.When you waste your life today, tomorrow you would find that life is leaving you. The earlier you treasure your life, the better you enjoy life.4. Love is nothing but a transient feeling, and this feeling would fade with time and with one's mood. If your so called loved one leaves you, be patient, time will wash away your aches and sadness. Don't over exaggerate the beauty and sweetness of love, and don't over exaggerate the sadness of falling out of love.5.A lot of successful people did not receive a good education, that does not mean that you can be successful by not studying hard! Whatever knowledge you gain is your weapon in life. One can go from rags to riches, but one has to start from some rags!6.I do not expect you to financially support me when I am old, neither  would I financially support your whole life. My responsibility as a supporter ends when you are grown up. After that, you decide whether you want to travel in a public transport or in your limousine, whether rich or poor.7. You honour your words, but don't expect others to be so. You can be good to people, but don't expect people to be good to you. If you don't understand this, you would end up with unnecessary troubles.8. I have bought lotteries for umpteen years, but could never strike any prize. That shows if you want to be rich, you have to work hard! There is no free lunch!9. No matter how much time I have with you, let's treasure the time we have together. We do not know if we would meet again in our next life.",positive

"MOBILE MONEY TAX IS 0.5%, NOT 1% PRESIDENT MUSEVENI""Mobile money transfer is a useful service. Since the informal sector is never taxed and I am always against those direct taxes on those sectors, is it too much for mobile money senders and receivers to also make a modest contribution to the development of their country? The 1% was a miscommunication. The actual figure was 0.5%. That is what we should debate on the mobile money,"" says President Museveni.READ FULL STATEMENT HERE >> https://goo.gl/XjTmau",positive

"Did you know that Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions, but they do not all pop at the same time. When flood comes, fish eat ants and when the flood recedes, ants eat fish. Only time matters. To make soap, oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required. This is the irony of life. Everybody needs somebody at one point in time. Do not despise or treat anyone with scorn. There is a time for everything and for everyone. Keep trusting and waiting on God. Your time to POP will soon come. God of creating ways were seems no way! Blessed day all!!!",positive

"*Your level determines your challenges**Sometimes you wonder why you experience big challenges in your life but I want you to know that they are proportional to your level. High level people do not face low level challenges . It’s the tallest trees that suffer the most wind. In a war they target the soldier who has the biggest weapon. In football they focus on marking the best player. The devil will attack you because he knows how powerful you are. Remember that whatever God allows you to go through he knows that you have the capacity to withstand it and come out stronger . Challenges are like steps of a ladder, each time you overcome them you go to the next level. I would rather face challenges as I go to a higher level than stay at a lower level without challenges.**1 Cor 10:13......And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear......*I wish you victory always.When *challenges* come.. Stay *strong in faith* knowing that God will see u through. Amen",positive
"George Carlin on aging!(Absolutely Brilliant)IF YOU DON'T READ THIS TO THE VERY END, YOU HAVE LOST A DAY IN YOUR LIFE.George Carlin's Views on AgingHOW TO STAY YOUNG1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctors worry about them. That is why you pay them.2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.3. Keep learning.    Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever, even ham radio. Never let the brain idle. 'An idle mind is the devil's workshop.' And the devil’s   family name is   Alzheimer's.4. Enjoy the simple things.5.  Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath.6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person, who is with us our entire life, is ourselves Be ALIVE while you are alive.7. Surround yourself with what you love   , whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, even to the next county; to a foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is.10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity.AND, ALWAYS REMEMBER:""Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away""We all need to live life to its fullest each day!!",positive

"An interesting piece from Angelo Izamas blog and a call of reflection with in us..If a planeload of senior government officials were to crush and burn today instead of days of national mourning, there may be instead days of celebration.Such is the mood, online and when you speak to people offline, brought on by the recent events in Arua.There is fear and resentment for those who wield the authority of the state. There is contempt, hate and helplessness too. It was Aime Ferdinand David Cesaire, the Martiniquean politician and poet who wrote about how violence can have a dehumanizing effect on those who wield it (by wielding it) and its victims.Even when those so-called victims free themselves from such violence, as was the case with the freedom from colonialization, they are marked by the violence wrought on them and as Mahmood Mamdani too said yesterday’s victims are tomorrow’s killers.In the last three years I have surrounded myself with the literature of violence in Uganda.Much of it was the story of state inspired violence from 1966 – 86 and thereafter the civil wars. In particular I was struck by the confusion of the Justice Oder Commission that made inquiries into the early period (I provide links to the testimonies on my blog below) on how we had degenerated into a despicable mess.They wondered how all these decent Ugandan men (and women) had turned into torturers and murderers as if they had gone to a monster university to learn how to be so hateful and evil.“We wonder how a security personnel developed such wrath to torture and maim someone he had never seen before just because the culprit was brought under his custody” they said. They pondered if it was “sadism for its sake”.Today many people don’t pause to ask how the nice guy you went to school with now spends his time tracking and harming “ opposition elements”.Part of what violence in society does to you is to make you accept it as normal. Many people even won’t notice their own indifference to the plight of those victims until it involves someone they know or something they value.They fail in principle to condemn all acts of criminal violence and impunity.In this way even if they did not stand in the same room as the fellows who, in the most recent case, allegedly beat up Bobi Wine and others, they had already endorsed it by looking the other way when for example hundreds died in Kasese, and thousands in Northern Uganda.Now in their present anger they may accept violence against those they view as responsible because violence in return is a form of justice they may think.This is wrong of course but we all feel this way sometimes.It is important to understand what being a witness to the madness of layers upon layers of violence does to you. For your own sanity.It will allow you to think clearly, or as Cesaire would say, to think dangerously even.One group I feel particularly sorry for are the very “bazukulu” who are unwittingly repeating our cycle of violence and dehumanization. The torturers who are our friends and bar mates whose Altezza’s and Prados we admire, who our sisters want to marry, those guys who while drowning their own despair in bottles of whiskey are the stars of the nightlife.We all have them in our lives.Mamdani once told me that they constitute also the brightest amongst us who rather than confront the mad state had become instead “handmaidens” of the same state. They were here in the 80s, driving their Peugeots, wearing expensive chains and perfumes, guns in their cars and innocent people in their car boots.We see them again earning their keep by obeying “orders from above”. In the period before 86’ one of the complications for society then was that the same torturers were the relatives, friends and in-laws of the dominant people in society. Intra-northern competition meant that killers were known but protected because they come from the same high society that was “in things” at the time.Even today in the contest between FDC (which I consider NRM in the opposition anyway), Dr. Besigye, Muntu and other leaders will have relatives, friends and in-laws amongst the very manpower that wreaks havoc on them because political contest is largely an intra-western affair.This contradiction allows a dangerous silence about who is doing the brutalizing. It anonymizes the perpetrators who sit behind the authority of formal state institutions. I feel particularly sorry if you are reading this and fall in the category of people who know, associate with and keep as friends these under 40-year olds who are the violent handmaidens of today’s state-based violence.I especially understand if in your shame you are keeping quiet about the violence we see today despite what it is doing to all of us. Turning us into hateful, spiteful and even violent people in our words and deeds.I asked a friend, a senior citizen and mentor, who lived through it all what advise he had in such times and he said that it was important to publicly condemn impunity and reject this violence. I add to this that if you keep toxic company and cannot name or shame them.Avoid them.Have a good day.http://angeloizama.com/remembrance-not-thanksgiving-ugblogweek-a-history-of-violence-revisited/http://angeloizama.com/argentina-house-in-mbuya-a-place-of-torture-revisited-in-uganda/http://angeloizama.com/musical-chairs-history-amin-and-public-order-in-uganda/On Cesaire “ Discourses on Colonialism”",positive
"Watching the video ofMrs. Barbie Kyagulanyi brought it back home for me...My late father, Basil K. Bataringaya was ""arrested"" from my grandfather's home by policemen and military personnel one late morning. He was brutalized right in front of our eyes. I was hardly 6 yrs old at the time.He was kept at the central police station of Mbarara. His name was even entered in the incidence book.He was later transferred to Kyamugorani prison before he was disappeared.My late mother reported to the CPS mbarara to ask to see her husband everyday at no avail, even after he had been disappeared, until some kind lower rank policeman lead her aside and told her to go home and look after her children who still need her because she would not see her husband and her continued visits might result in her being imprisoned and God knows what might happen.My heart goes out to Mrs. Barbie Kyagulanyi and her children.May the Good Lord give them strength to see them through this difficult time, and to have a chance to look after their husband and father.",positive

"Pr.Solomon Male writes.During the Arua by-elections, the issue of Bobi Wine hon Kyagulanyi has been blown out of proportions to the extent of causing him trouble & being framed for treason.What is never stated is that even without Kyagulanyi NRM camp would have lost. I don't want to dwell on FDC which is proving a spent force because of the hypocrisy of many of its MPs.When Abiriga was killed, the conduct of youths breaking chairs must have sent signal to any sane politician that NRM would not win the by-election no matter what Museveni did. People were fed up.The problem with Ugandan rulers is failure to discern growing discontent and turning to armed forces to brutally suppress dissent, & to judicial systems to frame, prosecute & persecute opponents with trumped up charges.If you can recall, Uganda's problems are rulers who refuse to peacefully leave power till they are forcefully ejected.Before end of tenure of Obote's Executive Premiership, he used the Army to overthrow the President Kabaka Sir Edward Muteesa, abrogated the constitution, came up with own constitution, turned to political opponents & imprisoned them & turned Uganda into a defacto one party stateOn 25 Jan 1972, Idi Amin discerning people's discontent toppled his Commander in Chief & was named Dada ( Father) because of his action, removing a tyrant.After tightening grip on power, Amin turned Uganda into what became to be known as the State of Blood & pronounced himself Life President. Many dissenters were either imprisoned or killed while others fled into exile & some joined armed groups which included Kikosi Malum, Fronasa, UNRF, etc. Eventually, riding on people's disgruntledness, Amin was deposed on 11 April 1979 by Tanzania People's Defense Forces backed Uganda National Liberation Army & an entire Uganda National  Army was driven into exile where many combatants later died in abject suffering.Lule reigned barely 2 1/2 months & was deposed by his own army UNLA.Similarly Binaisa was deposed by the Army UNLA when he attempted to cling to power.10-11 Dec 1980 were voting days. I voted when about 18 years 4 months old. Commonwealth election observers monitored the elections & though entirely rigged, okayed it as free & fair.When Semogerere declared that though election had been rigged, DP leadership had decided to form parliamentary opposition, Museveni who had vowed to go to the bush if the election was rigged honored his pledge and quit government, started the protracted armed struggle that finally brought him into power on 26 Jan 1986.Back a bit, President Museveni capitalized on people's discontent with the regime to build his armed struggle power base.People who  sheltered, fed, hid & spied for & fought for him were the ordinary & despised. Many lost their lives because of him.His armed struggle created un healing scars in many people's lives: orphans, widows, widowers & many who lost their children, relatives & friends, besides  loss of wealth & economic collapse. Those old enough remember Panda Garis, Mpawo Atalukaaba buses, Nile Mansions torture to death chambers, NASA, etc.Till he was deposed by his own army on 25 July 1985, Obote failed to read the tide of people's discontent & labeled NRA fighters 'bandits.'Even when his Chief of Staff was killed, he became even more hard hearted, intolerant, brutal & discriminative & in course creating more discontent.Nothing much to say about the Tito Okello Lutwa led Military Junta, a marriage of convenience by different fighting groups, Moses Ali's UNRF, Nkwanga's FEDEMU, Kayiira's Uganda Freedom Movement, etc. This was marked by anarchy worsened by NRA's resolve fight them culminating into the 26 Jan 1986 NRA / NRM start of reign, & pushing an entire army into exile & precipitating insurgences (Holy Spirit Movement, Lords Resistance Army, etc).Many people breathed sighs of relief that at last, war was over.At Parliamentary building after taking his first presidential oath, Museveni stated, 'This is not a mere change of guard: it is a fundamental change.'With promises of a self-sustaining national economy, respect for human dignity, democratic governance, defining Africa's problems as stemming from presidents who don't want to leave power, castigating corruption, electoral frauds, intolerance of oppositions, abuse of power & over dependence on the West or East & polarization between pro-East & Pro-West, he won Ugandans' trust of  making Uganda the pride of Africa.1986 to date make Museveni the longest serving President. His reign outstrips all his predecessors combined. He has had every good will to make Uganda what every right thinking Ugandan wants it to be, in vain. He has disillusioned  many of us who once thought him  God sent.He has drowned the youths hopes: licensing slave traders to sell into slavery those desperate for jobs & greener pastures; licensing thieves to open gaming (betting) companies  to loot & impoverish Ugandans desperate for riches; cohabiting with conmen & women in the pews who target people desperate for God, Jesus, & his divine interventions in their real life problems, challenges & needs & has let witch witchdoctors con & murder Ugandans desperate for breakthroughs.Cooperatives that once bolstered the agricultural sector were murdered.'Investors'  invest to kill the economy by setting up factories which import raw materials instead of using available raw materials, hence, promote foreign job creations while murdering our own job market.Do you remember   Masaka Cooperatives Cresp company which used to extract pineapple & other juices from  pineapples & other locally grown fruits? What happened that fruits rot in Nakasero, Owino, Kalerwe & other markets? Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, Riham & other beverage producers primarily use water from Uganda & import virtually all other raw materials from abroad, killing the would be forward linkages for the agricultural sector.It is only during NRM tenure that poultry farmers feed their chicken on sand, soils & other adulterations deliberately mixed in feeds & sold as feeds.The health sector is broken down while those in power seek medical treatment abroad.High corruption is the order of the day as millions of Ugandans are languishing in abject poverty & hopelessness. Thieves are protected by the state as if all Ugandans are blind & fools.I can write on & on. Why should people still trust Museveni & his NRM having failed for  32 years to deliver on promises?When people like BobiWine Hon Kyagulanyi, Rtd Col Dr Kiiza Besigye,  etc emerge, just like Museveni did in the 1980s, they ride on people disillusionments to ignite change. Framing, arresting, persecuting, killing them, dismembering them, etc do not sort disillusionments, only dealing with people's needs & issues makes reform agitators irrelevant. It must be remembered that one man's perceived traitor / terrorist can be another's patriot & hero.When General Fred Rwigyema was killed during the early days of the RPF invasion of Rwanda, did it stop RPF from over tuning Kigali & taking power? The answer is NO.Through all the years of his protracted struggles, Museveni himself, his brother Salim Saleh, Kahinda Otafiire, Elly Tumwiine, Jim Muhwezi, name them; had they been caught, they would have all been charged for treason & as the law stipulates, if found guilty & sentenced, hanged. But Uganda would have missed their invaluable services.It is therefore so sad that 32 years down his reign, power has blinded Museveni & his inner circle so much to forget where he & this country have came from & his promises at Parliament in January 1986 for 'fundamental change' & not a 'mere change of guard'Think about Mobutu Sesesekou, Muammar Gadaffi, Siad Barre, Saddam Hussein & their greed for power & how that plunged their counties into chaos they are struggling with today.Something to think about: the fourth Estate should have always reminded HE Museveni not to forget his promises & critically highlighted where things have gone wrong but many members are timid, or compromised & are therefore puppets dancing to regime tones, or totally ignorant themselves of Uganda's long & painful, & heartbreaking journey to where we now are.Many don't even know the lyrics 'Omwoto nawaka, omwoto nawaka... .Mwoto gunawaka  Kalasa nawaka, mwoto nawaka mwoto nawaka.....'Friends, Former Singapore Premier Lee JKwan Yew said 'To understand the present and anticipate the future, one must know the past, enough to have a sense of the history of a people.'Therefore Fourth Estate, instead of loose timid time wasting & noncommittal chats posted, post reminding the President, his inner circle & all Ugandans of our past so we don't mess & slip back into the dark & painful past. As you know, history can repeat itself.Therefore do the needful to awaken Ugandans consciousness.Thanks.Peace & blessings.Pr Moses Solomon Male",positive

"*Prayer chain for  our country Uganda.*Father in the Mighty name of Jesus I thank You. I thank You because all power belongs to You. Thank You  because You always answer my prayers. I ask for forgiveness on behalf of our land and  nation Uganda. Forgive us for we have not walked in your ways. I repent for all wickedness, injustice, nepotism, tribalism, hatred, bloodshed, idolatry, and having not given You Your rightful place in our nation. Wherever we have exalted any idol before You, please forgive us, Lord. Father, have mercy. Remember mercy, O Lord. I contend for my country, O Lord. You say, ask of Me for the nations. Lord I ask for the land of Uganda. Remember Your people, Lord, those tossed about, oppressed and trampled upon by situations, hunger and thirst. O Lord, remember mercy and heal our land. Bring the latter rains, O Lord, I pray. Open the flood gates of heaven and let it rain. I plead the blood of Jesus over this land. Let  that Blood that speaks better things than the blood of Abel Raise leaders that are after Your heart, O Lord. Give us leaders chosen by You and let them be vessels to bring this land back to the fear of You, O Lord. Let there be peace and love for one another. Let any power thirsting for the blood of any Ugandan be quenched by the blood of Jesus. I cancel violence in Jesus name. I decree peace, prosperity and blessing to this land. Let peace be upon Uganda, let peace be upon the four corners of this great land. In the mighty name of Jesus I pray. Amen.*For God and my country.We are doing a 1,000,000 prayer chain. Please don't break it. Pass it to 10 of your contacts. Thank you.",positive

"God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change; Courage to change the things we can; and the wisdom to know the difference.  Living one day at a time;  Enjoying one moment at a time; Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as we would have it; trusting that He will make all things right If we surrender to His will; so that we may be reasonably happy in this life and supremely happy with him forever and ever in the next. Amen",positive

"Somebody called me with this phone number 07060714545 telling me he was doing some registration online and he mistakenly put my number on what he was registering, that my number is similar to his number and that the password of what he was registering was sent to my phone which I actually saw as 6310.He was now appealing to me to give him the reset code that was sent to my phone so that he could finish his registration. I told him to call me with the number he claimed was similar to mine so that I could verify his claim, he told me he didn't have credit in that line.I got online to find out more, only to discover he was actually trying to reset my bank online/yahoomail password and that he is a fraudster, an account hacker and also a 419er. If I had given him the code which was sent to my phone, he would have used it to reset my bank online/mobile app account.Please let us be careful and vigilant.

"SAD & SHOCKING BREAKING NEWSBobi Wine's blood samples have tested positive for Dimethylmercury, a category 2 man made slow killing poison manufacured from North Korea. Research shows that absorption of drops as low as 0.01ml have been proven fatal with signs of poisoning manifesting after 6 months which is definitely late for any kind of treatment.The good news is that diagnosis has been done at an early stage however his doctors have recommended thorough tests to be made at both the National Screening Center and poison control centers in the US and the Rambam Health Care Campus in Israel who possess capacity to detect all kinds of poison. Dr. Barbara Kirrane a medical toxicology consultant based at saint barnabas medical center in New Jersey has joined the medical team of doctors working on Hon. Kyagulanyi.It is not yet clear where Hon. Bobi wine was poisoned but unconfirmed reports indicate this was done while he was arrested and held under military detention in Gulu and Makindye. It is not the first time for an opposition figure in Uganda to suffer from poisoning. Hon Hussein Kyanjo, former Makindye West MP revealed that he was poisoned when he became too vocal on the oil documents and sharing agreements that raised dust in parliament back in 2010.We shall keep you posted as more details emerge...the same poison that was used to kill the brother of Dr BESIGYE.

"Warning from PoliceDON'T SEND IT BACK PASS IT ONThis is the thing these days, with people out of work and needing cash (mainly for drugs!).  Beware, it's headed your way. Just last weekend on Friday night we parked in a public parking area.  As we drove away I noticed a sticker on the rear window of the car.  When I got home and took it off, it was a receipt for gas.  Luckily my friend had told me not to stop as it could be someone waiting for me to get out of the car.Then we received this email yesterday:  WARNING FROM POLICE: THIS APPLIES TO BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. BEWARE OF A PIECE OF PAPER ON THE BACK WINDOW OF YOUR VEHICLE (A NEW WAY TO DO CARJACKING!)(NOT A JOKE!) Heads up everyone!  Please, keep this circulating.You walk across the parking lot, unlock your car and get inside.  You start the engine and shift into reverse.  When you look into the rearview mirror to back out of your parking space, you notice a piece of paper stuck to the middle of the rear window.  So, you shift into Park, unlock your doors, and jump out of your car to remove that paper (or whatever it is) that is obstructing your view.  When you reach the back of your car, that is when the carjackers appear out of nowhere, jump into your car and take off.  They practically mow you down as they speed off in your car. And guess what, ladies ?  I bet your purse is still in the car! So now the carjacker has your car, your home address, your money, and your keys.  Your home and your whole identity are now compromised!BEWARE OF THIS NEW SCHEME THAT IS NOW BEING USED.If you see a piece of paper stuck to your back window, just drive away.  Remove the paper later!  And be thankful that you read this e-mail.I hope you will forward this to friends and family, especially to women.  A purse contains all kinds  of personal information and identification documents, and you certainly do NOT want it to fall into the wrong hands.Please keep this going and tell all your family and friends!DON'T SAY, I DON'T HAVE A CAR YET, BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR RELATIVES?PASS IT ON.",positive

"Muzukulu pens down to Grand Papa.OPEN LETTER TO SHWENKURU (JAJJA) YOWERI KAGUTA MUSEVENIDear Grandpa,RE: WE WERE NOT BORN THIS WAY!I hope this letter finds you in perfect health and good moods having prayed and believed that your handlers will let it reach plainly as written. (One finds it difficult to imagine how they report events to you.)Permit me to remind you that our story begun in Arua on 16th November 2015. During our meeting I informed you that you were dealing with a Kyemeza generation (Young people born during the 1980’s and 90s who had just grown up like a neglected plant without pruning). Grandpa you responded by saying that the “political pruning” fell under the docket of the office of National Political Commissar which prior to return of multiparty democracy and later Office of Secretary General which had been occupied by the following notable individuals; Col. Dr. Kizza Besigye, Dr. Chrispus Kiyonga and Rt. Hon. Amama Mbabazi. You asserted that Col. Dr. Kizza Besigye and Rt. Hon. Amama Mbabazi could have deliberately neglected this duty for their selfish gains (To use ideologically bankrupt youth to cause confusion) I thought I understood!Grandpa, I reiterate, we your bazukulu were not born this way, we were left to grow this way deliberately or otherwise. I will elaborate;ON HOOLIGANISM.Grandpa, you say we are hooligans, we were not born this way, the system made us believe hooliganism is a way of life. Remember Maj. Kakooza Mutale and his Kalangala Action Plan which has been meting out election violence since 2001? Grandpa you never condemned them even when former Electoral Commission Chairman Hajji Badru Kiggundu called for an investigation on them in 2011.Grandpa you remember on 10th August 2016 when a mob of “cadres” loyal to then our darling IGP uncle Kale Kayihura almost lynched judicial officers at Makindye Magistrates Court? Grandpa you never said that was hooliganism.Grandpa you remember on 3rd October 2017 when your then “loyal cadres” of Boda Boda 2010 attacked school children at Busega and battered a police officer? You never condemned them and we believed it was okay. Grandpa don’t say they are now in court, they are there on other charges not related to that incident. At least we now know that murder and kidnap are not politically accepted forms of violence.Grandpa the smashing of car windows was acknowledged as acceptable form of behavior on 28th April 2011 when Cadre Arinaitwe Gilbert Bwana smashed Dr. Kizza Besigye’s car and he was praised for his courage instead being reprimanded.ON REPORTING ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.Grandpa over the years we have learnt that when we, the bazukulu, report to you any wrongdoing on the part of officials closer to you, you never act (or take too long to act) and we end up suffering at the hands of these officials.Grandpa you remember Muzukulu Kirumira Muhamadi who informed you of “weevils” in police force way back in 2013 and you took long to act? He was ostracized, harassed and treated like “a rolex thief”. Grandpa he ended up being stripped of his hard-earned ranks and livelihood.Grandpa, on 17th May 2017 I wrote to Uncle Kale ,then IGP, requesting that he restores the waning image of Uganda Police Force by causing the arrest and trial of those involved in torturing suspects in Nalufenya, a letter I copied to you (Attached hereto). Grandpa you addressed this issue passively. It is not by accident that we still witness incidences of torture occasioned by members of the armed forces. We were not born this way Grandpa, you made us believe reporting erratic behavior was useless.ON BEING UNRELIABLE.Grandpa, your handlers say we are unreliable. How can we be reliable when during the 2016 Presidential Election campaigns some of the senior officials you assigned us to work with stole campaign funds and when we threatened them that we shall report them to you they arrogantly responded that you shall do nothing? Grandpa they were wrong. You didn’t do nothing, you appointed some of them in more powerful offices. We were so naïve grandpa. We didn’t know scheming off a few hundreds of millions to buy ourselves some toys was acceptable.Shwenkuru…Grandpa, how can you kunegura your bazukulu? Grandpa, during the same election period you gave some of your buzukulu SUVs and SFC guards saying their security and lives mattered to you. Grandpa immediately after elections you withdrew the cars and guards. Why grandpa? Why? Did their security and lives cease to matter? Grandpa we were not born this way, you made us believe we only matter during elections.The various Nyekundiire bazukulu groups such as Sauti ya vijana, Sauti ya wanainchi, Team Thorough, Western Youth Forum, NRM Rich Mind Youth, including NRM Youth League at lower levels who campaigned tirelessly for and were darlings during elections are burdening under the weight of broken promises, silently waiting for 2021 because when we attempt to join those who criticize the system society reminds us of how we shouted our voices hoarse in your support. Grandpa, what are we supposed to do under these disheartening circumstance?ON CORRUPTION.Grandpa you have been informed about how some people in your office have turned you into a commodity. An appointment with you comes at a cost, no wonder the likes of Bryan White have special seats in your tent. Grandpa we were not born this way, you have made us believe that what matters is having money regardless of how we get it. We constantly see glorified thieves and humiliated hard-working people.Shwenkuru, your bazukulu who worked in your call center of Tuongee were laid off without any compensation for their efforts. The same happened to those who worked in your office of National Chairman – NRM under Madam Molly Kamukama, the new PA came with new staff ethnically close to her. Why burden you Grandpa? Of course, you already know all this.Grandpa, you have been complaining of corruption for over 50years yet our uncles and aunties who are implicated in corruption scandals are awarded with juicy positions. Grandpa we were not born this way, we see these relatives on the streets where we toil every day, cruising in convoys with lead cars and we don’t know what to do, give us a signal grandpa, tell us what to do because we cannot pelt them with stones, the SFC will clobber us.ON SELFISHNESS.Grandpa, we were not born selfish, your muzukulu Buntu Enock, NRM Youth League Treasurer went missing almost 4 months ago. I say missing because the security agencies say they don’t have him yet his family members say he was picked by security operatives. But Grandpa when we meet you as executive committees  representing young people both NRM Youth League and National Youth Council we are too preoccupied with getting mugaati from you for our individual stomachs to remember the welfare of one of our own. We are too afraid to use social media #FreeBuntuEnock yet we join the crowd to say #FreeBobiWine because its what is trending.ON PEOPLE POWER.Grandpa, your handlers mislead you that “People Power Crusade” is made of “ideologically disoriented hooligans being misled by opportunistic opposition politicians”, which is not true. Allow me point out one group called “Kawempe Republic” which has featured in all campaigns from Kyadondo East, to Jinja Municipality, to Bugiri and even Arua. This group is made up of NRM youthful cadres who worked closely with officials in your office of National Chairman – NRM and after underwent ideological training at National Leadership Institute – Kyankwanzi (I know this because we were in the same intake). These cadres while at Kyankwanzi even composed the NRM Anthem with the guidance of Mr. Micheal Katungi. The reason for them joining “People Power” was highlighted recently by NRM Deputy Secretary General Hon. Todwong Richard as “…because NRM party failed to handle issues affecting them”.ON POOR PARENTING.Grandpa, uncle Gen. Elly Tumwine said we do all this because of poor parenting. It is true. The moral fabric of this nation was destroyed by bad examples. The ideology we are taught in Kyankwanzi is not what is practiced in the corridors of power. The revolutionary methods of work were relegated to the textbook long before some of us even learnt to speak. We are decaying Grandpa but we were not born this way, we have learnt from some of the worst political parents anyone can ever have. (Kwoza kwiba ohekire oba noyegyesa oryomungozi).ON DISRESPECT.Grandpa, you may have heard or seen people referring to you as “Bosiko”, Bosiko is a character in MTN Momo advert who came from the village on a bicycle and mastered the ways of the city. Some may use it to demean your person and to others it is good intentioned humor to the bazukulu by the bazukulu that eases these moments of tension. Ultimately what this signifies is that as an individual, by riding the bicycle carrying water and grass for the demonstration farm, you  demystified (ust like you demystified the gun) the image of the holder of the highest office in the land as a common man who has simply mastered the art of managing people. The best part in that advert is where Bosiko accidentally sits on the birthday cake for his children, takes them to the nearest shop and buys them queen cakes (Bwa keeki obwa bitaano). Clearly, kwoyaka omwana endahi omukwatsa ekyisamutuutu! Grandpa, some people sat on our cake and damaged it, we are dying of hunger both ideological and physical, please provide some queen cakes before we degenerate beyond salvage.Your honest MuzukuluIan Gumisiriza Jeremiah.NRM Cadre",positive

"Bobi is no longer a Ugandan, he is now an institution, he is a child of the world. He is loved from Kampala to Vanuatu, from Jinja to Mongolia.

"😂😂😂Since Museveni has been the most mentioned name in Uganda this past years, I think Oxford Dictionary should consider creating a space for him in the dictionary.For example:Museveni: /mu-se-ve-n/ adjective: hard, difficult, painful , troublesome, harsh, wicked, liar, bad, thief..Verb: Musevenu.. Past Tense: Musevenirised. Present Continuous:Musevening. Present Perfect: MeseveniseE.g:... Some girls always like to musevenise things,.... The test was Musevenistic,.... I had a very Musevenirised week.# Museveni: To complicate, make things worse, unbearable.E.g:... Please don't come and Museveniificate issues here.... The only way to reduce applicants is to Musevenify the process.... How was your exam? It was Musevenific !!",positive

"YOWERI MUSEVENI IS NOT UGANDAN HIS STORYEXPOSED: 95% of Ugandans do not understand the real Yoseri Tibuhaburwa Rutabasirwa Buzariranwa.Yoseri Tibuhaburwa Rutabasirwa Buzariranwa AKA Yoweri Kaguta Museveni is a Tutsi of Rwandan origin. He was born in Gisenyi, northern Rwanda.During the Hutu revolution (1959 to 1961) which overthrew the minority Tutsi dominion of Rwanda, Museveni and his mother (Esteri Kokundeka) left Rwanda and entered western Uganda as refugees. They were welcomed and well fed. Museveni's real father (Kayibanda) remained in Rwanda and then settled in Tanzania. After some time, Museveni's mother (Esteri Kokundeka) took another Rwandan man (Amos Kaguta) his step father. The two made love and got pregnant. The child born was named Caleb Akandhanaho AKA Salim Saleh and other siblings.Both parents were actually Rwandan refugees. Because of economic hardships in Rwanda, they decided to stay in Uganda illegally. Uganda was very kind to Mr Museveni. Uganda educated Museveni. After his school, Museveni decided to turn the barrels of the gun against the Ugandans who fed him and educated him. He shot his way to power through violence. When he took power in 1986, claimed that he was a Ugandan citizen of Ankole origin.He never restored the Ankole kingdom because they refused to recognize him as a munyankole and support him in the 1980's election. He was also living in fear that Ugandans might find out his true identity which might sabotage his chances of becoming the president of Uganda. Which means he would have not convinced the Baganda and others to join his bush war struggle. Being born a Rwandese means he does not qualify for the presidency of Uganda according to the constitution. You must be a born Ugandan to run for the presidency. He continues to be in power illegally and imposing himself on Ugandans.In 1995 he also changed Uganda's constitution to recognize Rwandese as a tribe in Uganda. Rwandese disguising and infiltrating the Ugandan government as Banyankole has also caused serious division between the Bairu-Bahima. Cause now you have the lower class and the upper class undermining one another. Which is causing a stereotype and misunderstanding against hard working Banyankole. Thinking that they (Banyankole) are all rich, lazy, favored and benefiting (scholarships, gov't top positions and the army) from his government which is not true, as this has become a common stereotype with the average Ugandan today.If you have been to Uganda its a beautiful country blessed with landscapes and nature. But corruption is one thing that can't go unnoticed. Yes, Uganda is being mismanaged in every sector across the country because Mr Museveni decides to choose family members (Nepotism) and (tribal loyalty) over competency. In the end result it has produced a failed state. If any of these people swindle public funds they would not be brought to account because they are related or have tribal loyalty to Mr Museveni.His survival to cling onto power depends on tribalism, favouritism and nepotism. In most cases, these people are incompetent and not qualified for certain key positions. That's why we have poor infrastructure, poor service delivery, poor currency, corruption and high crime rate. If anyone questions the status quo of our country's affairs your immediately accused of being tribal.But hey, that's not the point here.......To trace a certain problem affecting a nation or an individual. You investigate and find out the root causes......(Its called history) Yoseri Tibuhaburwa Rutabasirwa Buzariranwa AKA Yoweri Kaguta Museveni is not a Ugandan and will never be one.......plain and simple.Note"" there are not my words but history reveals its self you can't run from ur history.by Zaid Mufaransa",positive

"UPDF should not be deployed against citizens, says Bobi’s lawyerMr Robert Amsterdam recently burst onto the Ugandan scene following reports that he had been hired by Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine. Derrick Wandera caught up with Mr Amsterdam in an email interview.Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine (left), with his lawyer Robert Amsterdam in the US recently. COURTESY PHOTOBY Derrick WanderaAdvertisementFirst things first, how did you meet Bobi Wine?A human rights NGO asked me to help him when arrested in Arua. As torture was involved, I sent a lawyer the next day. Simon Wolfe.Is Bobi Wine paying you to represent him?I don’t discuss money when torture is involved. I have suffered personally from oppression which is why the narrative of the government is so funny. Their statements about me are not only lies but they are incredibly stupid. How can I be a Western [agent] when I often represent Western critics?And what reason would you have for representing Western critics?The West has been a mess for Africa. The focus on terrorism and the funding of armies is contrary to our interests as Africans. I am sorry if you look at me [and] I don’t look African, but Africa is within me and my children as I have been in Nigeria off and on since I was a boy.Talking of interests of countries, you have been accused of being a Western agentNot at all. I won the global prize for pro bono advocacy for my work against the UN where they abused a leading African expert. Instead the government tries to paint me as some Western agent. I am the farthest thing from that.You have been accused of destabilising governments…It’s a complete fabrication. I was asked to help Bobi by a human rights organisation. The fabrications in some recent articles in Uganda are just laughable.Why represent Bobi Wine for free?He is an incredible, talented charismatic emblem of African youth. He is a phenomenon to be embraced. We need to understand our youth is our only resource. I agree with Bobi. It’s not about him, it’s about the people. People power is what we all must embrace. It is a way to embrace change and economic and political growth.You have previously represented high profile politicians from around the world. How different is Bobi Wine’s case?Very different. None of my other clients were tortured. Uganda is somewhat similar to my work in Thailand.What happened in Thailand?Ninety eight [people were] murdered in cold blood during the Bangkok Massacre [in 2010]. I took them to ICC [International Criminal Court] and were charged with defaming the army. Very tricky.You represented former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was accused of abuses, including murders by his government. Isn’t this a contradiction for a person who says he stands for human rights?It is a phony fact. Thaksin took 25 per cent of the populace out of poverty. He is a hero to the Thai people which is why the military came up with bogus challenges.During your maiden press conference with Bobi Wine in Washington recently, you seemed to ask investors to rethink doing business with Uganda. Don’t you think this jeopardises the lives of millions of Ugandan’s who benefit from these foreign investors?No. The army jeopardises their lives. The government through its use of violence destabilises the country. I am simply a lawyer.You want the US to stop giving military aid to Uganda. Can’t this be looked at as to a move to weaken the UPDF’s capability to defend the nation, and to protect Uganda’s vital national interests?You are kidding right? The army needs training not more ammo. Right now they need to stop being deployed against their own citizens.How would you rate the Bobi case in regard to the other cases you have been handling?The government seems to have no real programmes for urban youth and development. They need to challenge themselves. It is at the end about serving the people of Uganda and Africa.What do you think Uganda’s problem is?Government must be an engine of h",positive

"This Piece blessed me a big deal👇🏾Plzzz go thruYears ago in the Philippines, I heard a story of a man who parked his car in his office complex in downtown Manila.There was a street boy nearby and to pick up some money, the boy asked if he could watch (guard) the man’s car while he was in the office.Several hours later, when the man came back to get his nice Mercedes, he paid the boy some loose change and, as he was getting in his car, the little street boy said, “Mister, you sure have a nice car.”The man was quite surprised that this boy had even spoken to him and said, “Well, thank you.” Then the little boy said, “Where did you get your car? Did somebody give it to you?” The man replied, “Well yes, somebody did give it to me.My brother gave it to me.”As he continued to get in the car, he expected the boy to say something like, “Oh, I wish I had a brother who would give me a nice car.”Instead, he heard the little boy say, “Your brother gave it to you? I wish I could be a brother like that.The man was so amazed at the statement of the little boy, he asked, “Have you ever been in a nice car like this?” The little boy said, “No.” The man replied, “Well, get in. Let me give you a ride.”The boy jumped up in the front seat and as they drove down the road, the man had to roll down the windows because the little boy was so smelly.The boy was so joyful and in awe that he said, “Sir, could we go get my little brother and give him a ride too?” The man said, “Tell me about your brother. Where is he?” The boy pointed at a poor slum area of Manila called Tondo.They drove there and parked and the man said, “Go get your brother and we will give him a ride.”The little boy ran down a filthy alleyway and a few minutes later came back with his little brother on his back, as he was crippled! The man said, “So this is your little brother; what’s wrong with him?” as they put him up in the front seat.The little boy said, “He had an accident. He’s crippled and can’t walk.”As they drove and talked, the man found out that the brother had a crippling accident and because his family was so poor, they could not get him the medical care he needed.The businessman said, “Well, my brother is a doctor. Why don’t we go see him and find out what he can do for your little brother.”After the examination they found that after a simple operation, the boy would be able to walk again.The operation was performed and the little boy who could not walk, but had a brother who loved him, was able to walk again.Why did all this happen? Simply because of the unselfishness of someone caring for someone else, rather than for himself.So, might we have the words on our lips, “I wish I could be a brother (or mother, father, sister, fellow worker) like that.”In the words of the missionary, the Apostle Paul, “…regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others” (Philippians 2:3-4, NASB).Yes, “I wish I could be a brother like that.”~ Author Unknown",positive
I wish I can be such a sister!,positive

"👇🏾not my words of course but found it worth reading.The Prostate Gland and its effect on us , (men only).Read it and apply, esp the part on diet.Useful for all MEN over-40:A useful article / talk on Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH) or in simple terms, Enlarged Prostate. Diet is the most important part of this talk which is something within our control; and it works.FULL TEXT OF PROSTATE HEALTH AWARENESS LECTUREMEN MUST READGentlemen,I am here to speak with you on Prostate. The topic is misleading. Is prostate strictly for men? Yes, ONLY men have prostate and ONLY men over 40 years but the healthcare enlightenment is for everyone. There is no woman who does not know a man 40 years and above, father, uncle, brother, son, friend, neighbour, colleague...Essentially what I will be doing today is health promotion. Responsible health promotion must provide three things:1. Information2. Reassurance3. A plan of action.Let me start with a background on prostate health.Everyone has a pair of kidneys. The job of the kidney is to remove waste. It is the LAWMA (waste management company) of your body. Everyday your blood passes through the kidney several times to be filtered. As the blood is filtered, urine is formed and stored in a temporary storage tank called the urinary bladder.If there were to be no urinary bladder, as a man walks on the road, urine will be dropping.Now think of the plumbing work in your house. Think of the urinary bladder as the overhead storage tank. From the storage tank, a good plumber will run pipes to other parts of the house, including the kitchen. God in His wisdom ran pipes from our urinary bladder to the tip of the penis. The pipe is called the urethra. Just below the bladder and surrounding the urethra is a little organ called the prostate gland.The prostate gland is the size of a walnut and weighs about 20grams. Its job is to make the seminal fluid which is stored in the seminal vesicle. During sexual intercourse, seminal fluid comes down the urethra and mixes with the sperms produced in the testicles to form the semen. So semen technically is not sperm. It is sperm + seminal fluid. The seminal fluid lubricates the sperm.After age 40, for reasons that may be hormonal, the prostate gland begins to enlarge. From 20 grams it may grow to almost 100 grams. As it enlarges, it squeezes the urethra and the man begins to notice changes in the way he urinates.If you have a son under 10, if he has a little mischief like we all did at that age, when he comes out to urinate, he can target the ceiling and the jet will hit target. Call his father to do same, wahala dey. His urine stream is weak, cannot travel a long distance and sometimes may come straight down on his legs. So he may need to stand in awkward position to urinate.Not many men will be worried their urine stream cannot hit the ceiling. Toilets are on the floor and not on the ceiling. But other symptoms begin to show.TERMINAL DRIPPLING:The man begins to notice that after urinating and repacking, urine still drops on his pants. This is the reason why after an older man urinates, he has to ring bell. A younger man simply delivers to the last drop and walks away. Just see an older man coming from the bathroom. Sometimes he may clutch the newspaper closely to hide the urine stains, particularly on plain colored trousers.HESISTANCYAt this point you wait longer for the urine flow to start. There are 2 valves that must open for you to urinate – the internal and external sphincters. Both open but because of obstructions in the urethra, you wait longer for the flow to start.INCOMPLETE EMPTYINGYou have this feeling immediately after urinating that there is still something left.As all these things happen, the bladder begins to work harder to compensate for the obstruction in the urethra. The frequency of urination goes up. Urgency sets in. Sometimes you have to practically run into the toilet. Nocturia also becomes common. You wake up more than 2 times at night to urinate. Your wife begins to complain.Men being men may not talk to anyone even at this point. Then the more serious complications start.Stored urine gets infected and there may be burning sensation when urinating.Stored urine forms crystals. Crystals come together to form stone either in the bladder or in the kidney. Stones may block the urethra.Chronic urinary retention sets in. The bladder stores more and more urine. The size of the bladder is 40 - 60cl. A bottle of coke is 50cl. As the bladder stores more urine it can enlarge up to 300cl. An overfilled bladder may leak and this leads to wetting / urinary incontinence. Also the volume may put pressure on the kidney and may lead to kidney damage.What may likely bring the man to hospital is acute urinary retention. He wakes up one day and he is not able to pass urine.Everything I have described above is associated with prostate enlargement, technically called benign prostate hyperplasia.There are other diseases of the prostate like:1. Prostatitis – inflammation of the prostate2. Prostate cancer – cancer of the prostate.This discussion is on prostate enlargement.I have bad news and good news.The bad news is that everyman will have prostate enlargement if he lives long enough.The good news is that there are life style changes that can help the man after 40 to maintain optimum prostate health.NUTRITIONLook at what you eat. 33% of all cancers, according to the US National Cancer Institute is related to what we eat.Red meat everyday triples your chances of prostate disease. Milk everyday doubles your risk. Not taking fruits / vegetables daily quadruples your risk.Tomatoes are very good for men. If that is the only thing your wife can present in the evening, eat it with joy. It has loads of lycopene. Lycopene is the most potent natural antioxidant.Foods that are rich in zinc are also good for men. We recommend pumpkin seeds (ugbogulu).Zinc is about the most essential element for male sexuality and fertility.Men need more zinc than women. Every time a man ejaculates he loses 15mg of zinc. Zinc is also important for alcohol metabolism. Your liver needs zinc to metabolize alcohol.ALCOHOL CONSUMPTIONAs men begin to have urinary symptoms associated with prostate enlargement, it is important they look at alcohol consumption. More fluid in means more fluid out.Drink less. Drink slowly.EXERCISEExercise helps build the muscle tone. Every man should exercise. Men over 40 should avoid high impact exercise like jogging. It puts pressure on the knees. Cycling is bad news for the prostate. We recommend brisk walking.SITTINGWhen we sit, two-third of our weight rests on the pelvic bones. Men who sit longer are more prone to prostate symptoms. Do not sit for long hours. Walk around as often as you can. Sit on comfortable chairs. We recommend a divided saddle chair if you must sit long hours.DRESSINGMen should avoid tight underwear. It impacts circulation around the groin and heats it up a bit. While the physiological temperature is 37 degrees, the groin has an optimal temperature of about 33 degrees. Pant is a no - no for men. Wear boxers.  Wear breathable clothing.SMOKINGAvoid smoking. It affects blood vessels and impact circulation around the groin.SEXRegular sex is good for the prostate.Celibates are more pronenn to prostate illness. While celibacy is a moral decision, it is not a biological adaptation. Your prostate gland is designed to empty its contents regularly.""Pieces of lemon in a glass of hot water can save you for the rest of your life,"" says Professor Chen Horin, chief executive of the Beijing Military Hospital.Hot lemons can kill cancer cells!Cut the lemon into three pieces and place it in a cup, then pour hot water, it will become (alkaline water), drink it every day will certainly benefit everyone ..Hot lemons can once again release an anti-cancer drug.Hot lemon juice has an effect on cancerous tumors andhas shown treatment for all types of cancer.Treatment with this extract will only destroy the malignant cells and will not affect healthy cells.Second: The acids and mono-carboxylic acid in lemon juice can regulate hypertension and protect narrow arteries, adjust blood circulation and reduce blood clotting.Advice:Professor Chen Horin",positive

"*FAKE EGGS IN UGANDA😱*In a disturbing case, the Police is hunting for four Chinese men who are reportedly making and selling fake eggs that look like chicken eggs.The unscrupulous entrepreneurs no longer wait for a hen to lay eggs, they make them using machines and chemicals. The fake eggs are made from concoctions that make them look like real eggs and are hard to distinguish. This was revealed during a sensitisation conference on the mandate of Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) at Silver Springs Hotel in Bugolobi, Kampala.Tip-offA senior Police investigation officer blew the lid on the puzzling practice that is raising concern about the safety of eggs available on the local market. “We got a tip from a lady who was mistreated by the Chinese and later dismissed. She gave us information that her former bosses were manufacturing eggs in Kawempe along Ttula road. We stormed the place but, unfortunately, the Chinese detected our officers and took off. We managed to arrested the two Ugandan men who were working with them,” Charles Twine, an economic crimes and anti-corruption officer at CID headquarters, said.According to Police investigations, the Chinese were detected in Tanzania and they shifted to Uganda. They used to import the chemicals for making the egg york and shells. “It is hard to distinguish between the fake eggs and the real ones. But when you crack the fake one, the shell comes off easily without leaving particles. When you salt it, the salt does not stick well because of the oil they use. It is hard to digest and has a funny taste,” Twine said.The chemicals which were picked from the Chinese factory are to be sent to the Government Analytical Laboratory to find out exactly what they contained and the dangers. The fake eggs are often sold at a slightly lower price compared to the market rate.A tray of normal eggs costs sh12,000, while the fake ones goes for sh8,000. The fake eggs are usually found in supermarkets and big markets like Kalerwe, Nakawa, Owino and Nakasero.Slow court processTwine said they get so many people with deadly products, but the court punishments are so weak. “The punishment for food adulteration is weak, yet the products cause death. That is why these days people have so many strange diseases. We need strong regional co-operation if we are to fight these economic crimes,” Twine said.Consumers have been called upon to be vigilant while buying eggs from supermarkets, shops, vendors and markets. UNBS comments Denis Odur, the UNBS market surveillance officer, confirmed the fake eggs report, saying they were waiting for Police investigations.“We received the information and when we visited the premises, we found some of their products wrongly packed with tampered expiry dates. We seized all the products and we are waiting for Police to finish investigations in order to pursue the case,” Odur said.Martin Imalingat, the UNBS head of market surveillance, called upon people to be mindful of other people’s lives, instead of focusing on getting quick money. “Money is not everything. Why do you manufacture eggs using chemicals?” Imalingat asked.How to recognize fake eggsIn 2011, a Chinese newspaper in Shandong Province, Qilu Evening News, asked Yi Junpeng, assistant professor for biological engineering at Henan University of Science and Technology, for advice on how to identify fake eggs at market stalls. Yi warned of eggs that are too perfectly shaped and smooth. “They have an unnatural unblemished shells which are also slightly harder and shinier than real eggs.Real eggs have a faint smell which fake eggs lack. Tapping a fake egg makes a hollower sound than a real egg. Once cracked open, egg white and yolk would quickly mix,” he said.He also said fake eggs yolk appears more yellow and has chalaze, which is the white string that holds the yolk. In fake eggs, the egg yolk and egg white tend to mix almost instantaneously when the egg is cracked open, while in genuine eggs, the egg yolk will stay apart from the egg white for a longer time.It will sound watery when you shake it because the chemicals inside do not solidify together.“If you break the egg and keep it for some time, the egg white and the yolk will soon mix with one another, since they are essentially made from the same ingredients. “The fake eggs do not stink even if cooked and kept in the open for days, and do not attract ants or flies. When you fry a fake egg, the yolk will be spread without being touched unlike a real egg,” he said._Share this article to keep others alert, They could be the Next Victim_",positive

Banange Ugandans can abuse the black off your skin. There is a war of words on FB. Sylvia Owori questioned why Barbie Itungo was invited to the panel on Geopolitics discussion oba conference. She acussed her of politicking mbu she is not one of the most influential women in Uganda. The citizens have abuse awori for 2 days  straight.,positive
Kyagulanyi Barbie Itungo Iam a little confused here. Are you one of the most powerful inspirational women in Uganda??? There are over 1000 women who should have rightfully been on that panel discussing Women issues. Let us not mix politics with meritocracy.,positive
Sylvia Owori The fact that you are not on the panel then you are not influential. Take a back sit and let Barbie shine. She is married to the most influential man in Uganda today and automatically with her wisdom she deserves to sit on that panel,positive
"Sylvia Owori your days are long gone,how influential are you yoself🤔🤔.you were once influentual in wat we all know which was selling young naive girls to older men because of money under your defunct zipper blah blah.why are yu hell bent on attacking the younger generation that is more useful than you were??Yes she deserved to be there and she was on the panel.#kikulume#Ripjajjaja#Tugyekoobumbula#Gaciya#Comebeatme",positive
"Questioning Barbie's presence on the panel is like telling the organisers that they didnt know who they needed. That is both rude & ignorant of you Miss Owori. A host has a right to choose his or her guest- basic etiquette. Dont mix politics aswell as meritocracy with the study of the effects of geography on politics and international relations(Geopolitics). Presently, she has the ""global"" following to have an effect women's lives.If Mrs Barbara Itungo was invited by the French embassy, then they saw her befitting to be part of the panel. She is educated, a mother, an enterpreneur above all engages in community development with the impoverished. Most importantly she is a wife to an honourable member of parliament who is also an entertainer yet balances it all.These invites arent about western accents and whose back a particular woman has ridden on or where one has travelled or which famous men she has dated. It is about women of substance. Barbie is a classy woman of substance who has stayed calm in the eye of the storm. Class cannot be bought. It is simply one's elegance and poise.",positive
"Don't worry, I am sure ""List of Men Slept With"" wasn't one of the qualities they wanted in a panelist. If it was, am sure you would have ended up somewhere on that panel. For now, you can as well ""f"" off.",positive
"Finally Sylvia has risen from the dead. Just being petty. I hope she didn't count herself among the inspirational women. The way she exploited young people to tailor for her clothes while paying them peanuts, then she could import China clothes and Shoes remove labels and replace with hers lying Ugandans mbu designer, then selling miss Uganda  contestants to the highest bidders. Please Sylvia Owori just concentrate on selling your kaftans the only thing left of your fashion brand. Mbu designer, we are tired of every person who knows how to use a sewing machine claiming to be a designer. Tumbavu.",positive
"DEAR SYLIVIA OWORI;My name is Ashburg Katto... If you have had your shine, why do you want to dim the light of another woman because your light is no longer shining bright or its completely put out? Why are women of yesterday pulling down fellow women of today?Sylivia Owori, you used to be a force to reckon with, from the days of Sylivia's boutique on Wilson Street, we were in Masaka and you were the talk of Kampala. You had the most expensive boutique. Infact if anyone walked into your boutique, you used to look at them from head to toe to see if they were worth your time. You judged peoples pockets by looking at them and before they bought anything from you.Then you went to Miss Uganda, you did so well, shined and you were on top of your game. Even when rumours were circulating around town that you were training mostly escorts instead of beauty queens, we still sniffed your name and let you shine.... (continue reading 👇)After many wasted years, you end up into a court battle with Nasser Sebaggala over your son Nielson Munk who was later changed the name to Adam Sebaggala. As a woman who is married to a white man, you ended up with a black child 🙆... Am sure you were so in shock that old man like Sebaggala still had live ammunitions in him. In other wards you are a married woman who sleeps around with married men. Now nyabo where do you get the audacity to talk about a fine woman like Barbie Kyagulanyi?So you need me to remind you that you lost the court case to Sebaggala, lost the Miss Uganda franchise, African Woman Magazine closed, faded off the showbiz charts, 4-4-2 magazine closed and all you have is a lousy boutique that sells grade 10 Chinese prints?So you desperately want a come back and you saw it fit to start attacking respected,  inspirational women like Barbie? Sylivia, Sylvia, Sylivia.....How many times have I called you?During your days of shining, you failed to inspire a single soul, you were running after married men, hooking up young girls with old pensioners hence nothing tangible you added onto the development of Uganda... (Akatalekeka 👇👇)Barbie Kyagulanyi is a force to reckon with, she is Executive Director Caring Hearts Uganda, which has helped many rural girls to make reusable pads, she is a business woman running and managing One Love Beach, Busabala, an author, please google the GOLDEN MEMORIES OF A VILLAGE BELLE, its selling on Amazon and on the syllabus of Rwanda school cirriculum, a mother of 4 in the same man and on top of that a wife to the most influential man in Uganda.Please rest your faded self and let this young woman be, let the future first lady shine, her time is NOW and she is using it right. Your time was YESTERDAY and you spent it pimping girls and running after married men............... Once again i remain Yours truly Mr. Ashburg Katto",positive
